Hey there! Welcome to my site. If you are interested in 

1) Forecasting 
2) Effective Altruism
3) Meditation
4) Online coworking 

please don't hesitate to [contact](mailto:matejsub007@gmail.com) me. :)

I wrote some content in th past [posts](/post) and [recommendations](/recommendations). But I aspire to write more and better.

My goal with this website is to crate living documentation of my personal projects and knowledgebase. Truth is it's had and I don't know how to do it. If you can help me with this I'd love to chat.

## About me
Well what's there to say. I'm aspiring world improver, forecasting enthusiast, meditation practicioner, hard worker, sort of nerd who also loves to dance, etc.

Some fun facts
- I have started reading when I was ~19, and then went all in.
- I went first time to sauna when I was ~22 and since then I take every opportunity to go in.
- I started meditating when I was ~23 and since then maintain long daily practice.
- I started biking at some point then cycled 1k km in 10 days and ~8k km in a year.

You get the point. When I like stuff, I try doing them.
