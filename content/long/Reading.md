[Note: this article will be updated over time. It's part of my long-content experimentation]

Reading is magic. This document starts with brief exploration of my personal relationship with reading. Afterwards I keep it practical. 

# Personal experience with reading
I started to read quite late. Around 18 years of age. For unknown reason I never started to read in my native language, and my initial motivation to start reading was to exercise my english language, once I reached the point that I could actually read books without much struggle. 

Since then I slowly began to experiment with different kinds of literature. At first, almost everything amazed me and I didn't though much whether the book is worth reading, or what is the best way to learn this information. I spent hours browsing bookdepository, amazing bookstore that delivers cheap books without any fees to anywhere in the world. After I found titles I liked, ordered them, and waited few weeks for books to be delivered. 

The joy of opening the package and looking at these marvelous covers, feeling the weight, noticing the smell. Openning them to see the typography, table of content, length of chapters. I was already calculating how long will it take me to read through this, what is the best strategy. I read 1-2 hours a day, it was easy, it filled me with curiosity. The world became more interesting, there was logic, things made sense. I found the path I can walk on. I found the books I could trust.

Afterwards I had my ups and downs, transitioned to ebooks to embrace minimalism, and read through more than hunderd of books (My goodreads tracker says 150+). Cultivating this relationship for about 7 years, I learned a lot about the art of reading. It's not a race to maximize the number of books read, but rather a love relationship. Deep friendship developed through space and time. Friendship with authors, ideas, stories. Conversation that never stops.  


# The most important

## Many books simultaneously

## Anything of interest

## It's okay to stop




# Tools and optimization

## Keep track
I found it motivating to keep track of the books I read. It's possible to keep this information in a simple text document, or a spreadsheet. For my current purposes the Goodreads works well. It allows me to keep track of "want to read", "currently reading", and "read" categories, rate the books, and review them. The data is easily exportable. 

Prioritization is a bit more difficult. I don't have any great solution here. If you have some good ideas, please contact me [direct@matejv.com].

## Audiobooks
I find audiobooks highly valuable. Especially on days when I'm unable to find that much time to read, or I'm tired from work and cannot sit anymore. I have to learned to do all kinds of activities while listening, such as walking, riding a bicycle, cleaning, cooking, falling asleep. 

For some people this limited attention could be a problem. One cannot completely focus on a book while doing other activity. In my experience this is true, but it's not necessarly a problem. Some books don't require my full attention and in fact I can enjoy them more while doing other activities. 

My favourite audiobooks are biographies, or fiction can be really well recorded. Though most of the audiobooks I listened to is general non-fiction that is often not ideal in this format, and it was worth it anyway.

The essential feature of any spoken audio-content is the ability to adjust speed. Don't be afraid to go 2x, or even 3x. Any speed that suits your needs in the moment is the correct one. The content should feel engaging. If it's not you might speed up, or slow down. If you understand less than 80%, it's probably too fast, otherwise too slow. This definitely changes across different recordings, or even during the same one.
