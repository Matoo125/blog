# Productivity
(Note: this is early version of this post, will require some revision)
## Why to be productive?
To open a discussion of personal productivity, we needs to start by asking, why do we want to be productive in the first place. This question is important and easily overlooked. Productivity starts with caring. Everybody cares about something. I personally care about my health and well-being, and that of my friends and family. The impact my work has on the world, and so on.

The ideal state we want to achieve is our desired output, and any action that leads us there might be considered productive. To increase our personal productivity means to get closed to our desired state in the limited amount of time, reach it faster, or use less effort. To become more productive means either to save time, or improve outcome. 

One of my main motivations for being more productive is the awareness of how precious the time is. It can be used exceptionally well by some people, and wasted by others. If nothing else, productivity is about value of time.
 
*We might live 90 years, that's about 33 000 days, 4 700 weeks, or 1 080 months. Third of the time we spent in sleep. If we eat an hour a day, that's 50 months over out lifetime. Significant part of our life is spent gossiping, watching movies, being bored, and other things we don’t even want to do. This makes our original lifetime budget significantly reduced. We already lived many years, months, weeks, and days. How well have we used our time? Let’s take a while to consider how could we use this time well, and then get as close to it as possible. It might give us some motivation to use the time wisely.* 

## The need for prioritization
Each moment we have an opportunity to choose from a very wide spectrum of activities. Imagine all the things we could be doing at random Tuesday evening: 

- write a blog post
- listen to podcast
- meditate
- cook food for tomorrow
- do a bit more work
- exercise
- call a friend
- socialize with my house mates
- go for a walk
- and so many more. 

In fact I could easily list hundreds of activities and their variations. If we take one of those activities, for example listening to podcast, we are facing a problem of too many choices again. Which podcast? Which episode? There are so many options to choose from. 

In reality we can handle most of these situations intuitively, without being overwhelmed by overload of possibilities in every single moment. It’s not so beneficial to throw out best time-intensive prioritization techniques at every single problem. But sometime small changes can have large impact. And some decisions can have long-lasting effect on our future. 

What you read today might influence what kind of work will you be doing for twenty years. Eating healthy food today might reinforce your identity as a healthy person, and allow you to feel healthy in your sixties, which will allow you to do more of the work you care about in the future.

The intuitive handling of prioritization often fails, and that is one of the reasons many people are not living their best lives. 

## Deciding what to work on
More often than not, the highest leverage activity one can do to increase productivity is not to try harder, but rather start working on something more important.


> What you work on is often underrated compared to how hard you try

To figure out what to work on, there are many techniques we could be using. Good starting point could be to ask Hamming question, such as “What is the most important problem I could be working on?”. We could experiment with different variations, such as what is the best thing I could do this year, day, or even hour. Or what is some small thing I’m overlooking, but it has large impact on my life?

The problem is that we often try hard working on things that are not important. Wasting time and energy along the way. To figure out what is important, it’s helpful to have long-term perspective. What do I want to achieve in my life? What kind of person do I want to be?  

Will MacAskill is using similar strategy to decide how to use his time and energy.

## Supporting my monkey brain

After we have decided what is the best thing to work on, the daily work begins. People are apes that can make plans. Our default behavior is to waste time on social media and complain about everything around. We can spend a lot of time talking about nothing interesting or important.

To overcome these natural tendencies we can use hacks, tools, routines, and best practices. It’s possible to learn to do things we actually want to be doing. 


> You will find that anything or nothing is sufficient to attract his wandering attention. You no longer need a good book, which he really likes, to keep him from his prayers or his work or his sleep; a column of advertisements in yesterday's paper will do. You can make him waste his time not only in conversation he enjoys with people whom he likes, but also in conversations with those he cares nothing about, on subjects that bore him. You can make him do nothing at all for long periods. You can keep him up late at night, not roistering, but staring at a dead fire in a cold room. All the healthy and outgoing activities which we want him to avoid can be inhibited and nothing given in return, so that at last he may say...'I now see that I spent most my life in doing neither what I ought nor what I liked.

**Good habits are everything**

We are our habits. Our everyday activity matters a lot! When we want to change our lives, we start to think about large behavioral changes we could do. Often the most important changes start small. 

If you haven’t read, and you feel like you could improve your habits, go and read Atomic Habits (and if that’s not enough, read Power of Habits as well)

**Coworking online**

The single best productivity hack for my personal productivity was to start working with people online. Look at [Focusmate](https://www.focusmate.com/dashboard), [Ultraworking](https://www.ultraworking.com/), or let me know if you want to have longer 1-1 sessions. Guzey [wrote](https://forum.guzey.com/t/i-no-longer-believe-that-its-possible-to-achieve-extremely-high-productivity-sustained-over-long-periods-of-time-working-on-difficult-projects-alone/329) why he thinks those are the best.

**80/20 principle**

Keep it simple, it can be always improved in the future. Don’t be perfectionist. Good enough people run the world.

**Accountability buddies**
Find 1-3 people to meet every week or two. Talk about your work, challenges and goals. Be specific, make a plan. Keep each other on the path. 

**Remove distractions**

Close unnecessary tabs, if it's too complicated close all of them (one tab). 

Keep working hard.

Work smart. 

Be happy.
