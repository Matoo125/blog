# Psychology applied to Modern Life

I finished reading introductory textbook to psychology. It was recommended here. After reading that post I decided to always read at least one textbook. My next step will be introduction to psychology. 

Another project of mine is to learn how to read and study. As many people I’m getting through many books each year, hardly remembering what I read months later. Most of the content is fine to forget. My goal is not to remember each word. Although that might be also interesting for some nicely worded thoughts. 

Many books I read have plenty of interesting ideas and stories, that are worth remembering. It might be as little as 10% of the book, or 1%. What I consider to be the most interesting ideas often stick with me, I talk about them to many people and make the memories stronger. 

There are hooks in my mind for these ideas, because they expand my current knowledge in a way my mind can manage at the moment. Other ideas need time, and more active engagement. That’s why I’m trying to write, reread some parts, and actively ask question: What is it that I can learn here? How can I change my mind?

Enough about my motivation. Part of it is me procrastinating from actually writing these notes. Other part is an attempt to remind myself what is my goal here. Not to write just to get words on the page. Answering the question What is it that I learned from this book? How it was useful to me?

I love psychology. At the same time I know almost nothing about the subject. It’s easy to delude myself by random facts, experiences, studies and theories. In most of the cases I have only superficial understanding of them. It’s easy to claim that I know what I’m talking about. In fact I do it often in my head. I want to counteract this tendency by cultivating acceptance of unknown. 

As with most of my writing. This is more about my relationship with this book, than some objective review or practical notes for others.  

# Definition

What is psychology? It’s a study of human mind and behavior. It’s closely related to question *How can we live the best live possible?* Part of it is avoiding malfunctions, such as procrastination, depression, anxiety, problematic coping mechanisms, etc. The other is promoting the good ones: happiness, kindness, achieving your goals. 

The basic premise is that our mind can be studied, problematic areas can be identified, understood and fixed (at least improved, or managed). We can become better people by doing so. There are many lenses we can use to see the human mind, mental illness, or flourishing. And we will do so in this post. 

# Modern Life

Each era has it’s own issues, though it can be underlined by the same principles, that were always present. What comes to your mind when asked about *psychological issues of modern time*? 

## Materialism

We have a lot of stuff today! They are great in many ways. I love my bike, fridge, toaster, meditation chair, yoga mat, standing desk, and more. I’m getting a lot of value out of these. 

- Ironically, however, those who embrace materialism are not necessarily all that satisfied with their lives. A recent analysis of 151 studies revealed that people who score high in materialism tend to report somewhat lower levels of subjective well-being than others (Dittmar et al., 2014).

Subjective well-being is definitely more important for me than owning stuff. The reason for collecting expensive items is always instrumental. We have a story that purchasing these products will make us better off. Whether it’s nicer car, watch, smartphone, notebook, or whatever. 

There might be a point in my life that these things will actually solve one of my problems and leave me better off, but that’s rarely the case. Most of the time, I’m just greedy, trying to solve my discomfort by novelty. It won’t work. 

Part of the problem is that by believing in materialism, we are not actually achieving our goals. We give so much effort to acquire things, when we desire love, understanding, or trust. Ask yourself a question: What it’s that you actually want from life?

It’s probably not a full bank account and an empty heart. Money are great technology that allows us to do magic as a society, and it can give a lot of freedom to individuals. They are definitely useful, but I’d think most of us can be misled by them. And confuse our tool with the goal itself. 

I think advertisement is evil, it actively exploits our vulnerabilities to make us unhappy. It can be ignored to a large extend, if you are wise enough to do it, but it has definitely a strong grip on many people. This is huge problem, because it takes our attention from what we really care about. It reinforces materialism in our society. 

- Why might materialism undermine well-being? One line of thinking is that adver-tising helps foster an insatiable thirst for consumption that is difficult to satisfy, resulting in frustration. Another proposed explanation is that the pursuit of material success can crowd out other experiences (leisure activities, time with family, exercise, and so forth) that satisfy important psychological needs and contribute to well-being. Unfortunately, research suggests that materialism has been on the rise in recent decades (Twenge & Kasser, 2013).

## Social Media

Nothing in the world is purely good, or bad. Except advertisement, and social media. They hijack our brains for the sake of selling us advertisement. Certainly it can be used for good. We can use it as a source of news, thoughts, ideas. We can find our best friends, business partners, or the love of our life there. That’s all possible, and some people are getting a lot of benefit out of it. 

But most of us are wasting our time, making ourselves miserable along the way. For me going to Facebook more than once a week to check at some groups is too much to handle. Other people are more resilient. Our attention is the most useful resource we have. We need to get back in touch with how important and beautiful every second of our lives can be. 

It’s easy to confuse the feeling Facebook is creating with actually getting closer to my goal of having meaningful and fulfilling long-lasting relationships. 

I love technology, by the way. But let’s be careful! 

## Too many options

The art of prioritization is more important than ever. The world is full of opportunities, some of them are much better than the others. Average options are often good enough and very comfortable, so it’s easy to get stuck with them and stop challenging ourselves. Many of us could be exceptional if we tried, thought carefully about our options and did the best we can do, even though it’s hard.

We can choose well! It requires us to keep track of terminal values and tracking *how are my instrumental goals helping me to achieve what I want?* This conscious process requires clear mind. Scrolling social media or buying another item you don’t need will make your mind cloudy. Rationalization and cognitive dissonance will make you loose track with whatever you truly care about.

## Search for Direction

Truth is: all you need is yourself. That’s a very vague claim that would be called psycho-babble by the Textbook authors. 

- The term psychobabble, coined by R. D. Rosen (1977), seems appropriate to describe the “hip” but hopelessly vague language used in many of these books. Statements such as “It’s beautiful if you’re unhappy,” “You’ve got to get in touch with yourself,” “You have to be up front,” “You gotta be you ’cause you’re you,” and “You need a real high-energy experience” are typical examples of this language. At best, such terminology is ill-defined; at worst, it is meaningless. Clarity is sacrificed in favor of a jargon that prevents, rather than enhances, effective communication.

We all recognize this emptiness within ourselves. As shown by the huge self-help industry that was developed to fill this void. Everyone has a cure, or simple technique that will solve all of our problems. “*We* *can make you better, more successful and fulfilled*”, many self-help gurus claim. This is larger issue in the US, but we Eastern Europeans are definitely not immune. 

Some of the self-help content and teachers are excellent, and they provide a lot of value to society. But it might be hard to recognize them. The existence of book The Secret is a great example. There are definitely some useful sentences or thoughts in a book, but the main idea is total bullshit. On the other hand Nonviolent Communication is possibly one of the most useful self-help books of our time. It has strong following, but comparably is much less popular. 

What are the most useful self-help books and activities?

## About Happiness

- The first of these ideas is the apparently widespread assumption that most people are relatively unhappy. Writers, social scientists, and the general public seem to believe that peo-ple around the world are predominantly dissatisfied, yet empirical surveys consistently find that the vast majority of respondents—even those who are poor or disabled—characterize themselves as fairly happy (Pavot & Diener, 2013).

Most of the people consider themselves to be happy. 

**What makes us happy?**

Money, Age, Gender, Parenthood, Intelligence and Attractiveness are weak predictors of happiness. 

Health, social relations, religious belief, leisure activity, and culture have moderate correlations with our happiness.

Relationship satisfaction, work, genetics and personality are strongly correlated with our happiness.

- First, research on happiness demonstrates that the determinants of subjective well-being are precisely that: subjective. Objective realities are not as important as subjective feelings. In other words, your health, your wealth, your job, and your age are not as influen-tial as how you feel about your health, wealth, job, and age.

This is all very interesting. It would be probably worth to considerable expand discussion of each factor, and see what are the possible explanation. 

## Conclusion

I addressed only the first chapter of the book. To keep things simple, I’ll end it here, and think about my next project. Going through the book in this way would take too much time to complete. I need faster cycles, maybe something like a post a week? That would be great habit. Shorter and to the point
