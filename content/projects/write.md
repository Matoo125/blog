I do have goal to start regular writing practice for several years. General pattern is that I get motivated, write for couple of days and then it fades away. I'm not exactly sure why it fades away, but my best guess is that I try too hard, and then it becomes exhausting to write, this creates a blind-spot in myself and I push all thoughts about writing away.

Over my few bursts of motivation I did got somehow better at writing. To sustain this as a habit I need to find a way to make it easy and rewarding.

This page is attempt to track my progress and gamify my experience a bit.

**Current goals**
- Write at least 100 words per day (28.11-5.12)
- Write first post on EA Forum until EOY
- Learn to write with "talking ease"

**Ideas**
- Update online coworking post
  - More call to action style and process + experience
  - Schedule some long coworkings with people
  - Try non-online experiment on the cottage with others and writeup
  - Write about marathon?
- Update Meditation post
  - Mainly write about online community, Ajan Brahm, experience from retreats, how my mind changed over the years. Make it more personal.


**Learnings**
- Writing takes time and it's easy to underestimate how much
- If you are doing low-stakes writing such as this blog, or even outreaching to people, it's natural to overthink it and make much bigger deal out of it than it is. I can talk to people without much thinking so why should I have such a high bar for writing?
- The only way to develop and sustain writing habit is to be rewarded during the process. Otherwise it slowly disappears.
- Simple text document is sufficient. Tools are mostly distracting unless you get advanced enough in the basics to get benefits. 
- Writing drafts needs to be easy. Everything needs to be rewriten if it's supposed to be high quality. Rewriting can be easy as well. Doing everything perfectly from the start is the hardest option.
- Writing can be very exciting. The excitement is what moves me through all my successfull projects. There are ways to find it in writing. If it's painful it won't last.

**Completed**
- write projects -> learning to write draft
- Write bunch of posts
- Write bunch of poems
- Write technical documentations
- Update index page
