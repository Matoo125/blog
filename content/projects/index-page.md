## Introduction

The best way to learn for me is through projects. It's how I learned all my best skills. Coding, cooking, meditating. So why not translate everything I want to do into projects? It allows me to track progress and do all kinds of project management practices. 

If done well this will allow me to avoid situations where
- I have made some decisions in the past. Such as meditate 2 hours daily, live in Prague, eat strictly vegan, work as a programmer. Then I continued doing these things without remembering why and questioning whether it still holds.
- I was exercising a lot regularly for years. Then I moved countries, exercise centers were closed because of covid, and my ability to exercise got lost. I wasn't able to reflect on this constructively for a long time.
- I forgot that I can do something that I already executed before. For example I did 100 push-ups every day, or maintained contact with enough people to feel comfortable. Then something changed (for example I didn't need to do push-ups anymore because my yoga studio opened, or I didn't need to maintain social contacts city-style because I moved to coliving environment) and suddenly I feel like a person that is not able to do what I did before without troubles.


Using the words project management might sound scary to some people. It doesn't have to be work and beurocracy. It's about creating systems and processes that makes things easier. Whatever you care about with good management you can get better results.
