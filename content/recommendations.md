*Note: when I look at my list of 5 star books, the main question in my mind is: wtf? ... I think it would be useful exercise to re-calibrate my old rankings according to my current standards. And only highlight books that really impacted me over long-term.*

List of all the blogs I enjoy reading can be found on my [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/p/MatejM4) feed.


### Tools

List of valuable tools

- Bluetooth keyboard and mouse of higher quality (I'm using them ~8h per day), but my frugal habits told me to use the cheapest combo for $10 for more than a year. It was totally okay, but given that I started to travel a lot, having something a bit smaller seemed like a good idea. I bought high quality combo for $50 and it was totally worth it.

- Kindle - allowed me to read hundreds of books. But whatever, some people can read 1000+ pages on their phones.
- Bluetooth headphones - magic, totally worth it, with noise cancelling, life saver
- Nice notebooks (I had trouble making notes on paper, until I bought nice notebook that I really liked for $5 which seems like a lot for a notebook)
- Exercise ball ($10), Kneeling chair ($50), Standing Desk Equipment ($30-$500), Chair support thing ($5)
- Good Earplugs - allow me to sleep well anywhere
- Brain.fm - ended up being surprisingly helpful. I listen to the same audio recordings from them for hunderds of hours and pay monthly fee for it. But it's much less distracting than focus classical or electronic music, or whatever alternative. 
- i3 desktop - not sure how useful this is, but helps me to have less distraction on the screen, and makes window switching easier.

### Found useful at some point
- Anki - but never managed to make habit longer than couple of months
- RoamResearch - Wonderful idea, but I feel like I'm not there yet.
- Pomodoros - now I prefer doing check-ins without breaks in most cases.
