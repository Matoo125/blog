After moving to Ericeira in Portugal, I have been lucky enough to find a house walking distance from Theravada Buddhist Monastery. I have been going there for evening meditation every day for the past month and recently I have managed to spend there the whole weekend. I wrote this quick post to capture my thoughts after the experience.

It's much easier to be present, and content with my experience. My mind is spacious and kind. At the same time, I notice difficulties adjusting to my daily life, after this experience. The main source of confusion is the difference between the personalities and actions of people in the Monastery and my coliving space.

In the monastery, everything felt calm. People were happy. We didn't need to talk much, although there was an opportunity for that as well. It wasn't a silent retreat. Daily experience in the monastery has its beauty. We had the first practice every morning at 5 am. Then there was cleaning, breakfast, work period, lunch, and free time after 12pm, until the evening mediation at 7:30 pm. 

I have felt close to people living in the Monastery. 6 monks, 3 novices, 4 guests, and people coming in from outside. We didn't talk about other people, we didn't gossip, we didn't complain about the world. We shared a lot of smiles, watched the trees, and the mountain view. Listened to the birds, and walked slowly on surrounding paths. 

Life was simple, full of presence, kindness, and generosity. Monks are people, who have decided to be happy and live to the fullest. Most of us are trying to find meaning in the outside world, by doing drugs, watching TV, talking with people, traveling, or playing games. But we can never run away from ourselves. No matter how hard we try, our subconscious will always get back to us. If you don't believe it, try to stop distracting yourself for a while and see what comes up. 

There are many meditative techniques taught in the West. After my weekend experience, they seem to be slightly over-rated. Simple awareness of the breath and body can take us all the way to enlightenment. No need for overthinking. Our mindset is much more important than the techniques. 

The mindset these people have is one of service. They don't own anything and live to help others. This is combined with the awareness that to help others, we need to help ourselves first. Therefore monks practice meditation to overcome selfish tendencies and desires. 

It's rare to see a community, that gives such importance to developing good qualities of the mind and behaving skillfully. Being a good person is a number one priority. What a wonderful and pleasant environment it creates. 

The key to practice is learning to accept reality in the present moment. During my stay in the monastery, I had an opportunity to observe. The world is constantly changing and everything is processed. We might delude ourselves for a while by controlling the world and other people, but it won't last. We don't need to have our way all the time

This isn't to say that we should stop trying to make the world a better place. In fact, I'm a strong believer that we should try as hard as possible. That is why I cannot choose to be a monk right now. I don't think that is the best way to improve the world I can choose. Though it's definitely a path of joy and inner peace.

Writing this text helped me to realize that following the teaching of the Buddha, and making the world a better place are the core tenets of my life. What does it mean exactly? 

I will try to answer that in my future posts.

Thank you for your attention.
