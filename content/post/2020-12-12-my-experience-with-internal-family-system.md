This week I finished reading the book Self-Therapy which introduces psychotherapeutic technique Internal Family System (IFS). I found it fascinating. 



Here is amazing [blog post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model) written by Kaj Sotala, explaining how this could make sense. If you are interested in theoretical understanding, this is the best source I know about. 



IFS seems at first glance as cartoon version psychotherapy. You have protectors, exiles and true self, and your goal is to make them like each other and cooperate. 



**Let me start from the beginning.** 

First important claim you need to accept is, that we are not single unified entity, but collection of sub-personalities. That’s not completely true either, but it’s a perspective this practice is using. Here, as with other mental models, or framework, the question is not whether it’s true, rather whether it’s useful. Can it be beneficial to think about ourselves as made up of different parts?



IFS says yes! And it can also help us solve most of our mental issues. After going through this experience, I have to say that I agree, but it’s more complicated. For now it’s enough if you are willing to accept point of view, where you are made of parts, that have independent personalities, experiences, and coping mechanisms. 



These parts often have communication problems. For example there might be a part that’s always judging other parts, and causes them to be sad and avoid complaining. It makes it hard for you to access the source of your sadness, there is only blank space, only emptiness. Then maybe something triggers you, and there is anger and frustration is taking over you again. You have no idea where it came from, except some petty reasons that seem to fuel it, but it’s there so strong!



The later case is caused by part of you (in IFS lingo called **protector**) that took over your control panel. We are switching from protector to protector without being aware that anything is happening at all. Business as usual. Our unified personality, right there. 



Why is all of this happening? Well, let me explain the cartoon characters in a bit more detail. It all starts with our **self.** A concept that might sound too woo-woo to some people, but it’s a concept, don’t forget that all of them are woo-woo in some way, if we take them too seriously! 



In IFS self is your core state, that is always compassionate, curious and caring. It’s a great place to be! In fact, the whole practice of IFS is about reconnecting with our self as much as possible. 



When we were babies we had a lot of access to our true selves, possibly we were even completely embodying it at some point in time. Then life happened. The world is confusing and we often don’t know what to do about it. It was especially true when we were children. Plenty of situations happened and we didn’t know how to handle them. So we developed protectors. Our coping strategies, that helped us to get through.



The situations that we didn’t know how to handle created parts of us that became hurt (**exiles**) and our coping strategies (**protectors**) are trying to minimize the pain. They were the best we could manage at some point in our lives, but we keep them even if we can do better. Unaware that any of this is happening.



There is a complex system of intertwined relationships between our parts. The beauty of IFS is in the simple solution it offers. All we needs to do, is to reconnect with our self, get to know our protectors, talk with them, share our worries and arguments, listen to their point of view, make an agreement, heal the exiles they are protecting, and let them take new roles. 



Okay, maybe it’s not so simple as meditation technique of focusing on your breath but definitely doable! Not to mention that simple instructions doesn’t mean it’s hard to execute. Many people find it easier to graduate universities and start companies, than to truly focus on their breath for a day or two. 



First question we need to ask is “How am I feeling right now?”, if I’m curious, compassionate and caring, then I’m in self and can continue the process. Otherwise I’m **blended** with a protector and need to separate. Our protectors are willing to cooperate much more than I would expect. 



It’s important to remember that all of our parts are wanting the best for us. I want to take some time to digest how radical this perspective is. What is usually happening in our minds, definitely in my mind, is that some parts of us (that totally want the best of us) are screaming at other parts of us (that want the same) and everybody ends us being hurt, tired, depressed, or fill the blank with your problematic mental states.



All these parts are doing their best, that’s wonderful! Once they see you can appreciate them for the hard work, they have been doing for you, they become much more open. Imagine doing something important for others, for years, and all you get in return is that everybody screams at you that you are doing it wrong. That’s not a good state to be in. 



Practice of working with protectors starts with gratitude. Now imagine you have a friend who always wants the best for you. Heart-warming, isn’t it? Remember you have plenty of them in yourself, it’s just that they need you to listen. It’s a practice of self-compassion towards all of your parts. 



Protectors cannot just let go what they are doing, because they are protecting something important! They are protecting exiles - parts of us that feel hurt. We need to heal exiles first, but that’s easier said than done. It’s essential not to scream at your exile! Give it some love. In my experience exiles are very perceptive and open when I approach them with compassion and curiosity. 



Love is the answer, would be my 4 words summary of this book. It has much more precise meaning than usual. It means love from self to all of our parts is the way to heal ourselves. When all of our parts are supportive and cooperative, life is full of joy. Even sadness can be beautiful. 



I was quite reluctant to talk about anything related childhood trauma in myself seriously before reading this book. I thought it’s just another way to delude myself and come up with excuses for why my life sucks and it should so. The key is to always approach it from the perspective of self (curiosity and compassion). It doesn’t matter what was the story, whether it’s true or not. Notice it, whether the fragment, bodily feeling, voice, or anything else. 



What does it wants to tell you? It’s interesting to see that once we can accept the reality inside of us, it often changes. Once we stop judging, analyzing and controlling everything the process will lead us into unexpected directions. Not to say that the mentioned qualities are bad and we should get rid of them. That is not the IFS way!



We are healing our parts, not analyzing historical events. I write this, because I get easily confused about the two. In reality it’s easy for the self to be replaced with a protector. And then mentally attack the other parts that are being vulnerable. That’s why the concept of self seems so useful. One can easily check: Am I being curious and compassionate right now? 



Thank you
