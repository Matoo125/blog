OpenAI made a GPT-2 language model, for predicting the next word in a text. The output is becoming suspiciously understandable. It was trained on 40GB of internet data. Humans learn to use language with much less training data. If I should read a 1GB my head would explode, or I'd die of an old age before. 

This machine doesn't have any direct understanding of the world, and the content it makes is far from perfect. But it's getting there and it'll not be worse. We'll die and new generations will have to learn everything again. And one day the best of us will loose the ability to beat the machine. It already happened with doing calculations, playing chess, go, protein folding and it doesn't going to stop.

Machines can transcend the limitations of living beings. Nobody knows how far their usefulness can go. Theorizing about the future of machine learning algorithms is not the point I want to make here, so let's focus on our imperfections. 

How many languages do you speak? About 40% of the world population speaks only one language. 43% is bilingual, 13% trilingual and then you have about 4% who speak four and more languages. That's about 300 million people. Not all languages are equally different, for example, I could learn to speak Polish, Russian, Slovenian, Ukrainian, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Slovak and Czech. That would be 11 languages, all of them Slavic and many people could learn them if they lived two years in each country.

Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian share 100% of words, it's the same language, with standardized slightly differently in each country. Czech and Slovak are very close, with about 95% of shared words and some systematic differences in usage. Similar effect can be found all around the world. Portuguese and Spanish are much closer then Portuguese and Russian. And when we adjust for similar languages, number of people speaking 4 and more languages would drop drastically. 

Why would we even want to speak so many languages? On [list of polyglots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_polyglots) wiki page are some hints about what kind of people are motivated to do so.

- professional sportsman, who change teams and countries, so it's reasonable to learn several languages over the years. 
- authors, poets, writers, actors, artists
- politicians and diplomats
- academics, linguists and translators

Knowledge of many languages seemed to be more useful in the past, then today. At least for a few scholars and diplomats, who often traveled and it wasn't sufficient to speak English all the time. So they learned 10 and more languages over their careers. 

So how many languages can a person speak? Well 10 is a lot, but some go further. Ioannis Ikonomou, translator for the European Commission could speak 15 languages by the age of 20, now he knows 32 living languages (and 15 more dead languages, that's kind of weird). 

Ziad Fazah used to hold Guinness Book World Record for being able to speak and read 58 languages. But then they tested him on Chilean TV and he failed in most of them. Recently he said, he could speak only fifteen languages without preparation. Which is still utterly impressive. 

Google Translate is not a person, it's a code and a database. It can translate more than 100 languages without forgetting and a need for preparation. It responds to more then 200 million people daily and gives the answer instantly. It's only 12 years old, first ten years it used statistical models, last two years it uses neural networks. 

Professional human translator given enough time can beat GT in quality of the translation easily. GT is clearly faster, more accessible and can translate many more languages. People have a tendency to think, they are unbeatable language speakers, masters of words, transmitters of meaning. No species in animal kingdom communicates with the nuance and complexity as we do. 

Even though we are unparalleled speakers of words at one level, there are reasons to think, we are pretty terrible communicators at the same time. Or in other words, if you zoom out the scale there is plenty of space for progress. Not guessing the next word, but deliberately trying to figure out what you are trying to say and then starting to talk, might be great first step. Not every word has to be planned upfront in every situation, but we should be at least aware what is the situation we are in, what are our goals in this moment, and do all participants understand what we are doing.
