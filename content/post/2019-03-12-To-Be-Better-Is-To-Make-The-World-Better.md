[epistemic status: random mix of thoughts]

Have you ever felt, that you can be better? Of course you did, everyone does, it’s part of human experience. We are beings with the ability to improve. Even dogs can be trained to follow commands and to become more disciplined, but obviously, humans are more flexible.

We are able to think in words, make up complex stories and then believe them, look at reality using scientific method, look at ourselves using introspective techniques. Being big brained Homo Sapiens is amazing experience full of opportunities. On the other hand not everything is shinning, and there is a dark side. We are able to behave badly and lie, gossip, make fun of people, or perform horrible atrocities and destroy whole villages, cities, species.

For some reason we have been given powerful brains and ability to significantly transform the surroundings. Nobody can change the world alone, even though some people (such as Mandela, Gandhi, Gates, Einstein, Hitler…) for better or worse, might seem like they did. They used a lot of opportunities provided by other people, services of others, learned from others, cooperated with others. A full book could be written about this. 

When thinking about the world we need to consider other people. Without them, nothing makes sense. No matter how introverted you are, whether solitude brings you happiness, you cannot disconnect from reality. We are social animals. Huge chunk of our understanding of the world comes from the way we interact with others.

The knowledge we have exists, thanks to societies and individuals who create and protect it. Keeping it alive accumulating and improving upon through the generations. Everything around us, from technological gadgets connecting us in milliseconds, transportation vehicles saving our time while moving us through space, buildings sheltering us from negative aspects of the environment, food nourishing our bodies, clothing covering our skin, culture providing us with inspiration, to the thoughts we are thinking, is a result of impressive collaboration across minds, groups, cities, countries and centuries.

So do we want to keep it as it is, and do nothing about improving the life around us even further? For me the answer is simple. I want be part of the world improvement movement, do something for those who were not yet born, so they can have better lives. In the same way as I have this amazing life, thanks to many people from the past, who never met me, never could imagine the world I'm living in, and did it anyway. 

Even today, people who were not lucky enough in the lottery of being born, are living in poor countries. It doesn't have to prevent them from living a happy life. But it’s a clear disadvantage, and they suffer real problems we have hard time to imagine. The world requires our attention, problems are waiting to be solved. And many opportunities to become a better person through improving the world are surrounding us.

To improve the world you don’t have secretary-general of United Nations. You are also part of the world, and there is always something you can do. Most likely you'll never be appointed as a leader of UN, but why would that be your goal anyway. Your goal should be something tangible in the end. If your goal is to end poverty (whatever that means), think about what is the most effective way to do it, consider your capabilities and constraints, and give it your best.
