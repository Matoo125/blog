[This is a short motivational argument for creating a better world]

Have you ever felt, that you can be better? Of course, everyone does, it’s part of human experience. Beings with ability to improve. It’s different from training a dog to follow your command, maybe not completely, but to a large extent. 

We are able to think in words, make up complex stories and then believe them, look at reality using scientific method, look at ourselves using introspective techniques. Homo Sapiens is amazing. Yes, we are able to behave badly and lie, gossip, make fun of people, or perform horrible atrocities and destroy whole villages, cities, species.

For some reason we have been given powerful brains and ability to significantly transform the surroundings. Nobody can change the world alone, even though some people (Mandela, Gandhi, Bill Gates, Einstein, Hitler…) for better or worse might seem, they did. No man is an island and we are impressive at cooperating.

It doesn’t make sense to think about the world without thinking about other people. Without them, nothing makes sense. No matter how introverted you are, whether solitude brings you happiness, you cannot disconnect from reality. We are social animals. Huge chunk of our understanding of the world comes from the way we interact with others.

The knowledge we have exists, thanks to societies and individuals who create and protect it. Keeping it alive accumulating and improving upon through the generations. Everything around, from technological gadgets, transportation vehicles, buildings, food we eat, clothing, culture we live in to the thoughts one is thinking is a result impressive collaboration across minds, groups, cities, countries and centuries.

So do you really want to keep it as it is and do nothing about improving the life around us? For me the answer is simple. I want to improve, to be better, do something so those who were not yet born will have better lives. The same way I have amazing life thanks to many people from the past.

Even today, people are living in developing countries. They were not lucky in lottery of being born. Often it doesn't prevent them from having a happy life. But it’s a clear disadvantage and they suffer real problems we have hard time comprehending. The world requires our attention, problems are waiting to be solved. And many opportunities to become a better person through improving the world are surrounding us.

To “improve the world” you don’t have secretary-general of United Nations. You are also part of the world, and can be improved, maybe not to the level of being appointed as a leader of UN, but why would that be your goal anyway. Infinite number of better realities are waiting to be seen. Pick one and go, pick another and go.
