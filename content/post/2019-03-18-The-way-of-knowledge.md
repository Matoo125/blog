[epistemic status: weak unfinished thoughts]

In the last post I argued that it make sense to strive for self and world improvement. The life has a great potential of being amazing or terrible. People can care and cooperate to create better future for everyone, or destroy the world by acting negligently. Humans are gifted with astonishing power to change the world and responsibility to use it wisely.

People have moral systems and value hierarchies. With terminal values on top and random value-feelings wallowing at the bottom. Our instincts, as well as conscious planning help us to act in accordance with out values, although in different ways.

We are our own black boxes, if we don't try to understand ourselves. The evolutionary pressure for precise self-understanding and consistent action is weak. Luckily, we have access to the vast ocean of accumulated knowledge and ability to learn and swim in it, as no other species. Unfortunately, there might be equal or even larger ocean of accumulated stupidity, where it's hard not to sink. Therefore learning how to discern between useful information and a piece of trash is invaluable for our decision making. 

Life is not only about sun shining at flowers, although it's beautiful image and I'd love if life was about that. There are people farting in public transport and it's hard to breathe. Many things in this world are wrong and could be improved, including us. We have a natural tendency to see mainly extrinsic problems and ignore that we are most likely an external problem of someone else any time of the day. Multiplying the probability, that you are the source of the problem, that can be solved by 2 can bring us closer to reality. (be aware of the law of equal and opposite advice)

The knowledge of an individual is small by default, but it can grow a lot. When you talk to people with PhDs and random folks on the street, you might sense a little difference in their levels of understanding, or they might seem like from totally different planets. Going all the way through an university is not the only way to become smart and definitely not a guarantee, and being without traditional education doesn't block you from acquiring knowledge. But there is definitely a correlation and people who read a lot (high quality non fiction material) seem to have more accurate understanding of the world than those who spend their time watching movies.  

The choice is not whether to learn or not. It's what to learn. We cannot turn off our learning capacity (except for brain damage), so we'll learn many things and nobody wants to learn useless trash. When you watch TV series, you'll learn a lot about TV production, actors, archetypal stories, popular culture and so on. When you follow the smart people, you might become really smart one day. 

Reading is definitely underappreciated in standard population. Many smart people write books and articles. Meeting the greatest people alive is not easy, but there is high probability they already wrote a lot of content, or at least somebody expressed their ideas for them. Knowledge, that can be accessed almost instantly. 

Update: Active engagement with information is necessary, it's hard to learn something with passive absorption (such as default reading mode).
