I.

Achieving goals and fulfilling desires is common across the animal kingdom, even plants have a goal of getting enough resource to survive and thrive, it optimizes to achieve. This process doesn't have to be on a conscious level. Genes can hide it, many unconscious processes can hide it, we don't even need to have a conscious part to watch what's happening. 

People have many goals in the same way as animals do, and on top of that some of those goals might become part of consciousness. I have no idea about the consciousness distribution across species, so let me focus on humans. We have usual goals such as getting enough food and water, being accepted as a part of the group, finding the partner for reproduction, having a power that can be used in time of crisis, not injuring ourselves. But these are relatively easy to get in our society. 

We created an environment where it's easy, because of our ability to achieve. Everything necessary is accessible without trying too hard. Getting to this point haven't convinced us to stop, we set new goals, since we like doing stuff, improving things and optimizing the world around. Some people are not aware, they have goals, at least they said it to me, many are unsure about their goals and few actually thought hard about setting the right goals. We are heavily influenced by our surroundings - family, friends, acquaintances, culture (tradition, music, movies, famous people ...) and unconsciously derive our values from them. 

To some extend, it's possible to pick your influences and therefore choose an external pressure that will be changing your values. Those at non-conformity side of distribution have more freedom at leaving social groups and having social interaction while not mingling believes.

[disclaimer: story you heard many times below]

After World War 2, social psychologists became interested what makes people deny humanity of their fellow citizens, in so short period of time. Ash conformity experiment showed how people deny their own senses under an influence of a group. The Stanford Prison Experiment randomly separated people into 2 groups with strongly stereotyped social roles of guards and prisoners. Prisoners are expected to disregard the law and authority, meanwhile guards are controlling and aggressive. At the first night [2:30 AM](https://youtu.be/x3wxEmHqVCY) guards began harassing prisoners by waking them up, counting them and familiarizing them with their numbers. Prisoners were made to do push-ups as a form of physical punishment. It doesn't sound so bad, but actually the same technique was used in Nazi concentration camps.

The [next morning](https://youtu.be/uTdttd7XTfQ) prisoners decided to rebel and barricaded themselves with a bed in their cell. Guards got angry and used an fire extinguisher to force prisoners away from the door, rushed in, stripped prisoners naked and took their beds. At this point participants were living their roles. Guards started to use psychological tactics to gain more control. Trouble makers were taken into solitary confinement, and to create mistrust, a cell of special privileges was created for the most cooperative prisoners. They were given back their clothes and beds, could brush their teeth and eat special food. 

To create confusion guards assigned random prisoners into privileged cell. It signaled cooperation with the guards, so it created distrust among prisoners. Afterwards several prisoners became depressed, desperate and emotionally broken. Experiment should run two weeks, but they ended it after 6 days, because guess why. Actually the story continues, you could probably guess "because of the abuse" or "it got out of the control" and you would be right, but that wasn't enough, one more important factor played the role.

[end of the story you heard so many times]

Christina Maslach a recent Ph.D graduate was brought in to interview the prisoners and guards. She became disgusted after seeing prisoners marching with bags over their heads, legs chained together, keeping arms on each others shoulders. She strongly objected against the study and demanded end. Out of 50 outsiders who had seen the prison, she was the only one who ever questioned its morality. They complied with her and ended the study, prisoners were happy and guards not so much. It's interesting to see, that not only prisoners and guards played their roles, but also people from the outside, who understood their role as an experimenters, visitors, or whatever actor, and not questioned the game. 

Oh and Christina then married Philip Zimbardo, the main researcher, because why not. Philip became fascinated by the fact, that even though most people comply, some act when nobody expects them to, and become heroes. Nowadays he runs a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting heroism in every day life. And publishes papers like "A conceptual analysis and differentiation between heroic action and altruism.". Real scientific hippie story with happy ending. 

III. 

Being hero is cool, especially when someone is watching and you know they do. Or at least you think they do even when they are not. Why would anyone want to be a hero without recognition? Maybe they have believes, that world should be a better place, understand game theoretic principles and act in a way they would want other actors to act. And how do you know there won't be an opportunity to tell someone about greatness of that moral action? We could all kill each other, it wouldn't be such a big surprise, but for some weird reason we are not doing so. International trade and capitalist societies make everyone busy. Unbelievable number of people are cooperating, nobody knows how the system works, but it holds everyone (well many of us) alive. 

Cooperation makes perfect, in-grouping fuels friendship, compassion, altruism, and heroism. Out-grouping makes us kill and torture each other. If your life goals promote out-grouping go read again about SPE. To avoid oversimplification, there are some possibilities where out-grouping might be useful. For example you want some certifiable out-group of surgeons or nuclear engineers. Otherwise we could go extinct in a blink of an eye. Grouping around a specific skill might be unassociated with assigning human value. But all of this requires effort and understanding of how our natural tendencies might lead us to unwanted directions. 

It's not useful to question whether [life is worth living](https://thinkingbrain.blog/post/2019-04-04-reason-to-live/) all the time and in the same way questioning everything about a system continuously wouldn't allow us to do things. The common argument I get after introducing rationality to people who never met great rationalists, is something like "thinking is time consuming and reading that long article would cost me my weekly brain power and science made atomic bombs anyway". And yes, that's true, but there are at least three arguments and consensus about the meaning of the words, concepts and topic of discussion has to be made if we want to make [progress](https://thinkingbrain.blog/post/2019-04-07-dont-eat-the-menu/) in our discourse, so let me answer one by one. 

First yes thinking is hard, and painful process, but it can get much easier if you can divide your problem into parts, that are challenging enough, but possible for you to solve. Then it becomes fun, and even though many people can get there, it's hard to stay for long, or enter by will from different sides. Techniques to improve your critical thinking, decision making and problem solving skills exists and can be further developed. Internalizing them is  different story, but with a huge payoff. Process of investing into your future, is called being a student and giving it 13-23 years of your is a social norm. Unfortunately schools are often not doing a great job at teaching the most useful skill of them all - how to think. They are great at teaching you to follow orders, fulfill the requirements and cheat at tests to get there. And this makes people skeptical about thinking. But thinking is defined or limited by the way they teach it at schools.

What is a week of brain power? Not that much if it can improve your life or anything for that matter. The result can be exponential gain and [accumulated knowledge](https://thinkingbrain.blog/post/2019-03-18-the-way-of-knowledge/). This is not about reading any specific article, but going into  a right direction. As I already said, the question is not whether you'll do something with your brain, the question is what. And your brain will process it, reinforce connections and boom, learning happens. YOU ARE LEARNING RIGHT NOW! so be aware what you are doing otherwise you might become the victim of feedback loop to hell. No pressure, but awareness is the only place where the choice can be made. And you want to be able to get there and choose what do you want your brain to learn.

"Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom." - Viktor Frankl

Science is not a moral saint, it's not a person, but a technique, or a method to investigate the phenomena and learn about the world. Scientific findings can be used in all kinds of ways. Knife can be used to kill people, but that doesn't discredit it's usefulness for cutting vegetables. People with scientific mindset are thirsty for knowledge. They want to understand the complexity of the whole and every little detail it constitutes of. Curiosity is their driving force that allows them to ask the right questions and not be satisfied with ungrounded answers. But there is one necessary component - willingness to accept the truth no matter how uncomfortable it is. And even though there are many different opinions among the scientists, they are all looking at the same facts, playing the same game, looking for the truth. 

IV. 

The world around us is changing extremely fast, we need to learn how to adapt, to keep up with the pace. Without vigilance the opportunities will fly by unnoticed. So how can we decide, to stop looking and go with the one in hands? Completely probably never, we should keep the door open, even if it might slow us a bit currently. But it'll keep us in touch with the ideas so we can react on time when necessary or useful. 

Life is a long game, you have a one life and cannot go back. There is a lot in that sentence, so let's unpack it. Life is always longer than your longest experience, it might not be so drastic if you are close to the end, but otherwise it's possible you only lived something between 1/2 to 1/5 of your life. Especially in a later case there is no way to imagine remaining 4/5 realistically. If you recall the fact that you feel like a totally different person compared to few years ago, a lot of uncertainty is added to the mix. The difference between 15 and 25 is much larger then 45-55, since in a later case you already had 20 years of developed brain at your disposal, and the difference is only 2/11 of your life. In a former case it's 2/5, or if your memory began working at 5 it's basically one half. 

So you have hard time to imagine what comes ahead. Every single moment of your life, you have been in the now, with limited working memory at your disposal. George A. Miller wrote one of the most highly cited papers in psychology "[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two)" where he investigated how many objects can average human hold in his short-term memory. He discussed one-dimensional absolute judgment task, where subjects had to recall different tones varying in pitch, they all could remember 5 or 6, but not much more.  Then he looks at memory span, or the longest list of items (digits, letters, words) that a person can repeat back in correct order immediately after presentation on 50% of occasions. The word "magical" used in the title was only rhetorical, but it can be accessible heuristic.  

Nelson Cowan responded by "[The magical number 4 in short-term memory: a reconsideration of mental storage capacity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11515286)" cited almost 6000 times. And he took the word "magical" more seriously. Subsidizing, is counting briefly flashed objects on the screen. It cannot be hacked by counting them one by one, or by chunking them by four, it has to be recognized all at once. And people seem to be limited at number 4. This lower number resulted from more rigorous control for rehearsal, grouping and other shortcut techniques. 

In any case present moment is exceedingly limited, but our future is lengthy and highly depended on present action. If we can leverage the position of our future self, by equipping it with better skills, habits, more accurate knowledge and useful concepts, it'll be very grateful for what we have done. Memories, that increase our motivation and social connections could also be added. 

Even though going back in time is impossible, most of the situations can be repeated in similar way and you can learn in a forward fashion. But there are few critical moments that are hard to change by learning after the fact, for example debilitating car accident, buying too much bitcoin with loaned money, making an unexpected child in [El Salvador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_El_Salvador). And things with slow feedback loop such as getting cancer after decades of smoking, bad eating habits, sleeping habits, not exercising and well, basically any disease. Be careful, think about the future and don't let it suffer your present ignorance, because you have only one life. 

It's common to confuse the situation that cannot be repeated, repaired and improved with the one that can. And even if it cannot be repeated it often can be repaired to a large extend. And there is always the possibility, to accept the critical failure and focus on improving a different aspects that are open to forward manipulation (except edge cases that really limit your health, cognitive abilities or dying). 

V.

As you can see, having the right goals is hard and nobody can give you simple four bulleted answer. To summarize my intuitions, asking questions such as, 

- How will my future self feel about this?
- How does this action affects others?
- Do I have conflicting tendencies pulling in different direction, that prevent me from going into the right direction?
- Do I play the long term game?

can be helpful.
