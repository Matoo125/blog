In the last post I made an small argument why does it make sense to strive for improvement. In short, the life can be amazing or terrible. People can act beautifully and create better future, or do damaging acts and destroy everything. Gifted with astonishing power to change, and responsibility to use it wisely.

We all have moral systems, value hierarchies with terminal values on top and random value-feelings wallowing at the bottom. Instinct makes us act on them, as well as conscious planning, although in different ways. 

Without trying to understand ourselves, we are our own black boxes. No surprise, evolution haven't optimized us for self-understanding and consistent actions. Lucky us, with access to bottomless pit of accumulated wisdom, and ability to learn as no other species known. Unfortunately, there might be equal or even bigger pit of accumulated stupidity. So learning how to discern between useful information and a piece of trash is invaluable for our decision making. 

Life is not all sun shining at flowers. There are people farting in public transport and it's hard to breathe. Many things are wrong and could be improved including us. We have a natural tendency to see mainly extrinsic problems and ignore that we are most likely an external problem of someone else any time of the day. Multiplying the probability, that you are the source of the problem, that can be solved by 10 can bring us closer to reality. 

The knowledge of an individual is so small, but it can grow a lot. When you talk to people with PhDs and random folks on the street, you might sense a little difference in their levels of understanding, or they might seem like from totally different planets. Going all the way through an university is not the only way to become smart, and being without traditional education doesn't make you stupid. But there is definitely a correlation and people who read books seem to have more accurate understanding of the world.  

The choice is not whether to learn or not. It's what to learn. We cannot turn off our learning capacity (except brain damage, or drugs - temporary brain damage), so we'll learn many things and nobody wants to learn useless trash. When you watch TV series, you'll learn a lot about TV production, actors, archetypal stories, popular culture and so on. When you follow the smart people, you might become really smart one day. 

Reading is definitely underappreciated in standard population. Many smart people write books and articles. Meeting the greatest people alive is not easy, but there is high probability they already wrote a lot of content, or at least somebody expressed their ideas for them. Knowledge, that can be accessed almost instantly.
