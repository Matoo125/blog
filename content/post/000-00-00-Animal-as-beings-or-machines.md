So far I mostly wrote about motivation and meta thinking type of things. It's time to get into the meat of it. I mean I'm going to write about meat... milk, eggs and more importantly their fakes.

Abuse of animals on factory farms is one of the biggest challenges we are facing today. They are sentient beings with ability to feel pain. We have no way of knowing how does pain feels for them and how different is their consciousness from ours. Actually that's slightly misleading, even though we are far from certain, there is a lot of evidence pointing into particular direction. 

At first, let me clear few things out. Animals are not humans, but humans are animals. Since Darwin came with the theory of evolution, we know the difference between us is not a matter of kind, but of a degree. Pain is one of the oldest phenomenon, it seems to be present in fish, crabs, octopuses and everything above. Some facts, such as existence of Opioid receptors are pointing even further and include insects, mollusks and  nematodes. The point of my inquiry will be the focus on the most relevant species of our food system - cows, chickens, pigs and different fishes. I will often write about first three species as an one group and fishes as another, since our relationship with them is quite different. 

My claim is that pain is an objective phenomenon, even though we have hard time to measure it as such. What we often do with humans is that we ask them "How painful does it feels on a scale 0 to 10?" they answer "I guess it's about 6 and a half" and that's about it. And animals have hard time answering this type of linguistic questions, so you know, screw them and their experience. Our inability to measure pain directly does not make it go away. 

There are good reasons to dismiss objective existence of the pain. For example placebos, hypnosis or acupuncture might decrease it. Cultural differences are influencing our pain threshold and tolerance. Our expectations also play a role. And most importantly people perceive standard stimulus differently. It makes sense to narrow our focus to pain caused by damage to body and inability to fulfill our natural needs. 

Animals are giving us plenty of signals we can measure. 

> If the animal stops activities that it habitually  performs in  conditions that might  be  supposed  to produce pain, if it learns how to avoid such conditions, and if it has parts of its nervous system dedicated to avoidance of damage, then there are grounds for worrying that it might feel something.  And these concerns are made much more acute if it has a large brain relative to its body and shows some of the cognitive capacity seen in humans.
