So far I mostly wrote about motivation and meta thinking type of things. It's time to get into the meat of it. I mean I'm going to write about meat... milk, eggs and more importantly their fakes.

Abuse of animals on factory farms is one of the biggest challenges we are facing today. They are sentient beings with ability to feel pain. We have no way of knowing how does pain feels for them and how different is their consciousness from ours. Actually that's slightly misleading, even though we are far from certain, there is a lot of evidence pointing into particular direction. 

At first, let me clear few things out. Animals are not humans, but humans are animals. Since Darwin came with the theory of evolution, we know, that the difference between us is not a matter of kind, but of a degree. Pain is one of the oldest phenomenon, it seems to be present in fish, crabs, octopuses and everything above. Some facts, such as existence of Opioid receptors are pointing even further and include insects, mollusks and  nematodes. The point of my inquiry will be the focus on the most relevant species of our food system - cows, chickens, pigs and different fish species. I will often write about first three species as an one group and fish as another, since our relationship with them is quite different. 

My claim is that pain is an objective phenomenon, even though we have hard time to measure it as such. What we often do with humans is that we ask them "How painful does it feels on a scale 0 to 10?" they answer "I guess it's about 6 and a half" and that's about it. And animals have hard time answering this type of linguistic questions, so you know, screw them and their experience. Our inability to measure pain directly does not make it go away. 

There are good reasons to dismiss objective existence of the pain. For example placebos, hypnosis or acupuncture might decrease it. Cultural differences are influencing our pain threshold and tolerance. Our expectations also play a role. And most importantly people perceive standard stimulus differently. 

Pain itself might not be so bad by itself as the suffering it creates. It's just a signal that something is not right stored in dedicated part of the brain to avoid repetative harmful behaviour. Evolutionary feature, helping animals not to bleed out and pause before our bones are broken. It's something in the real world we can define quite clearly. But suffering is much more abstract, there has to be this perceiving entity that is conscious of the pain and doesn't want it to be present. 

When this conscious self (or I) is not satisfied with reality a suffering arises. So when people subscribe to Descartian believes of non-human animals as automata - machines that are quite similar to us, but without the conscious observer with magical rational powers, it is sensible to believe they cannot suffer. They can feel pain, but not the suffering, similar to experienced meditators, who after decades of practice silenced the talkshow in their heads and are perceiving the reality of the present moment as it is. 

There is famous photograph of an Vietnamese monk who burned himself alive while meditating calmly, his consciousness at peace. This is what happens when you control your consciousness, you have a choice to respond to a stimulus, even if it's extremely strong, such as your whole body on fire. People without long training are not able to achieve this level of equanimity. It's enough to look at others who self-immolated, most likely running around or rolling on the ground. 

Burned animals would behave as an untrained human. Panicking and unable to control themselves. But the difference is, some people would say, that it only acts on the strongest stimulus, without consciousness that can make choice if trained. It can be trained, but only mechanically, responding to rewards and punishments. While humans posses this soul-ish like consciousness that oversees the whole process underneath and has basically infinite value. 

This is becoming overly complicated, for most people it's enough to have a dog to start believing in animal consciousness. They can see personality, emotions, moods, memory, definitely a being that can feel pain and suffer. For sure, differences between people and dogs are quite large in some aspects. They posses smaller and much less developed brains, their ability for abstract and complex thinking is far behind ours. But as with anything else, there are many similarities and then, there are points of critical disctinction and other less important distinctions. 

This raises a question: Is there a point of critical distinction in the nature of consciousness that makes people able to suffer and other species not? 

(?I'll narrow my focus to pain caused by damage to body and inability to fulfill natural needs.)

Animals are giving us plenty of signals we can measure. 

> If the animal stops activities that it habitually  performs in  conditions that might  be  supposed  to produce pain, if it learns how to avoid such conditions, and if it has parts of its nervous system dedicated to avoidance of damage, then there are grounds for worrying that it might feel something.  And these concerns are made much more acute if it has a large brain relative to its body and shows some of the cognitive capacity seen in humans.
