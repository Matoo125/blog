Note: this post is even more free-flow writing than the others. 

*Habits fail after a while.* 

*Salience goes to background*

*Sound of your past self gets silenced*

*Time to review your habit trial*

**State of confusion**

This pattern happens often

- I’m not satisfied with something in my life
- I improvise focusing-like technique to specify the problem
- I brainstorm ideas and come up with a plan to fix this issue
- If the problem is systematic the solution is most likely some sort of system or habit
- After a bit of iterations it works great (or I made a mistake somewhere and go to previous stages)
- I’m amazed of how well the system works
- I start to focus on other things
- I don’t even remember how did I stopped with the habit I was so amazed about
- I feel somewhat guilty, because it worked so well and now I’m not doing it
- I’m not really that interested to go back to the original habit, because it doesn’t seem important now. Things have changed, but it still feels kind of bad.

The problem above is that some part of me has a static view on a dynamic process. It doesn’t want to acknowledge [nebulosity](https://meaningness.com/nebulosity) and constant change. It likes certainty and clarity. Unfortunately the world doesn’t work like that, and I need to train this part of me to see the reality more clearly. 

On some level, it feels weird to say that I’m constantly changing, and my environment does the same. It reminds me of people who claim that we cannot know anything interesting about the future. Thinking that “nothing is predictable” is fixation on a [confused stance](https://meaningness.com/confused-stances-come-in-pairs). 

**Non-obvious tendency of my mind**

By thinking about the future, we can assign probabilities and weights to possible events and plan to increase our chances of achieving our goals. When creating my systems I often create a snapshot of my mind when I have a plan that I’m happy with. And then I somehow forget to update on the new information. It’s not a rule and that makes it more difficult to track. 

Instead of moving forward, I compare myself with my past aspirations that were not fulfilled. Thinking backwards to consider your past self, and see whether there is something you forgot in a meantime makes sense. The problem is when this process is not constructive (what are the informations I can get to make the best decisions now), but is self-blaming (you are not doing what you thought was the best idea, and you don’t have a perfect explanation for it, so you must be a bad person)

Imagine A being a part of you that is tracking your past mindsets, goals and aspirations, and compares them to your current self to check whether you are living the life you want to. It gives you the objective information by default. But then it meets part B that wants you to feel consistent, competent and wise. A will point to some inconsistency and B (working in background without enough mental power) will come up with a rationalization. A knows you from the inside, so it will see that this is unlikely and point it out. B will get frustrated and try again, until it’s totally exhausted.

The example above is trying to illustrate how the inner-conflict can happen and escalate without any effort from the subject. Many of these processes are our learned mental patterns. On the other hand, we have useful coping mechanisms that help us to avoid staying negative for too long. In reality what is likely happening most of our waking lives is the interaction between our somehow problematic mental patterns, and reasonably-adjusted coping mechanisms. And here we are, normal human beings going with their lives as usual. 

**The way out**

As someone who tries to optimize my mental landscape (among other things), it makes sense to me to put a conscious effort towards identifying there patterns and try to replace them with better alternatives. The solution is most often some sort of TAP, even though I’m informal in applying them. I need to change the way I think or behave. Most often the combination of both, but I’d like to highlight the later. Even when the problem seems to be on the level of mind, it’s often more useful to focus on the action you are doing. 

Returning to the pattern from the beginning. The problem is somehow obvious to me. I miss doing reviews. But what kind of review system would work best for me? Or maybe better question - what kind of system would be good enough to start with, using minimal effort? It’s far too easy to fall into the trap of over-optimization of unnecessary details and then failing to execute. We want to achieve our goals and not to reach perfection on the quality line we don’t care about. 

To me this means starting simply, without giving myself too many rules to follow. Experiment with different approaches, and evaluate how it goes. All I need is a pen and paper, or recorder and my voice, another person to hear me out, or a focused space in my mind to do this. The point is to enjoy the process. Or see that results are so beneficial that it’s worth doing anyway. 

**Some of my systems that were working well**

To avoid making this post completely abstract, below are 4 of my systems that I got a lot of value from. This is a quick braindump and I plan to create a more systematic version that could be useful to others. 

Daily task planning - whether in Complice, sheet, kanban board, or paper. It works magic to think about your day, write it down and mark the completion afterwards. Also it’s helpful to review your day. 

Interaction tracking - one of mine favourite experiments was tracking of all the interactions with people during COVID quarantine. It was kind of effortless to have a lot of conversations with people and I enjoyed it a lot. I kept track of type (in-person, call, videocall), date, length, and notes for each interaction. For each day I had a counter of days since the last interaction to help me see how it differed from my intuition and to decide who to approach next. 

Long morning and evening rituals - meditations, breathing techniques, cold exposure, day planning etc, anki cards learning. 

Detailed work planning - sometimes my mind gets stuck instead of thinking what is the next step in my task / project. To overcome this it’s helpful to plan for example the next working hour in detail. Or try to divide the task in micro-steps. Often I make a mistake of not doing this and everything takes longer.
