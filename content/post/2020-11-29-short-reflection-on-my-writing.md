Since beginning of this blog, I was interested in making something long-term. Collecting my thoughts and ideas across areas I care about and updating them over time. In turned out, that with my limited time, limited knowledge and limited writing skill, it was harder task than I imagined. In the end I was happy to be able write anything at all from time to time. 



I find writing essays valuable. It often leads me to interesting unexplored places. It’s fascinating to see how little do I actually know, what are the empty zones in my thinking, and what really happens when I try to follow my arguments to their conclusions. I can learn by being with myself, and exploring what is already in my mind. 



This might not sound surprising, but it goes against my impulses to always consume something new and never stop injecting more information, more distractions, more confusion. I might be addicted to passive consumption of information, because it’s much easier than to actively engage with it. Also it’s seemingly safer, since nobody can blame me for my bad thinking process and other mistakes. 



My real goal is to understand the world and myself, among other things. That requires courage to be wrong, intellectual humility, and drive to learn from my mistakes. Currently I fall short on all the mentioned criteria, but I’m trying recognize, that my goals live in the real world, not in my mind. It’s often difficult to distinguish. 



This blog is far from the place I would idealize it to be. I find it surprisingly difficult to translate my ideas into words and sentences that make sense. Part of it is that my ideas are not developed enough, other part is that there is a lot of writing work ahead, to reach my desired level of skill. Both of these are solvable, but it requires me to accept where I am at this moment. Accepting my shortcomings if difficult. 



I think I should be a better writer. This also applies to other areas, such as better thinker, mathematician, conversationalist, or brother. It might be healthy to have goals like these. It can be converted into desire to become the person I want to be. Unfortunately, more often than not, it’s unproductive self-blaming of *not being able to do what I should be able to do*. 



“Shoulds” are always dangerous. But they can be crazy-good at hiding. Maybe over time I’ll get better at recognizing them. Maybe I already made surprisingly good progress (or at least adequate) at recognizing them, but every new “should” I notice is evidence, that I didn’t win my life back. Part of me feels like I should be better at this. And rather than accepting my current state of being, it guides my attention away, into imagined world. In this world I have more resources. I’m my ideal self, but fail to live up to it’s standard. That makes it difficult to learn. Not accepting my current situation is counter-productive. 



Truth is I’m not a good writer, among other things. And that’s okay.
