I.

There is a [story in the](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/2/7/18215586/india-man-suing-parents-giving-birth-antinatalism-raphael-samuel) news about an Indian man who is suing his parents for giving him a birth without his consent. Obviously people think, he is crazy. I won’t go into the details and think Vox did a great job explaining reasonings behind this case. I brought it up, because it is based on one basic and interesting idea, and use it as an starter of this article. Nobody has ever chosen to be born. Ever. 

Not me, not my mother, father, grandmother, grandfather, ... the first human, the first primate, the first mammal, the first vertebrate not even the first eukaryote. And in case you ask, not even you, your mother, father... So we all happened to be born, confused and scared, having no idea what’s going on. Then as we were growing up many unexpected and interesting things happened. We learned from our parents about world, words, emotions, proper behaviours, bad politicians, corruption, time, family, what to eat and where to sit, teeth cleaning and so on.

At school they taught us about wars and great inventions made by unseen geniuses, who were just like us, but completely different. We traveled with our fingers on the map, memorized it and then played guess where is the Angola and which are the neighbouring countries of Bolivia game. We were scored and ought to take it seriously, since our future depended on it. It all seemed so convincing that we started to believe in the show, this is how the world is and it cannot be much different. We started to believe others know what they are doing, what’s worse, we started to think we know what we are doing. It makes sense - how could you after so many years of education be completely lost and have no idea what’s going on?

All those talks, songs and movies about being confident, working hard, creating family, being faithful husband or wife, raising children getting old and dying to let others come on the scene is a great story of how life should look like. It makes us feel secure and prevents from thinking about the fact, that nobody knows what the hell is happening. 

We are these world dominating great apes living on a huge rock flying through the space in a overwhelming speed 30 km/s and rotating at calming 460 m/s and cannot even notice, unless we do those weird rituals, where it’s forbidden to listen to your heart, take systematic observations and do controlled experiments. 

II.

Every morning after eating breakfast of responsibility and taking the pledge to seriously not consider anything that could change our minds, because it’s confusing and scary, we take on our clothes of importance and as prescribed in our daily routines go to work or school to breathe in the false security and illusion of permanence, have some random conversations leading nowhere so we can feel good about ourselves and be accepted in the eyes of others.

We all live in our little personalized Truman Show in the same way everyone before us did. Our understanding and knowledge is limited, so we refuse to look deep into the unknown, because it would be unimaginably hard to make sense of it. The constraint of time makes us prioritize activities and go with the flow, since it was the best idea one could manage to think of.

For some reason we all play along in the game nobody chose. According to my best guess the reason is that we all want to live. We weren’t consulted whether to be born, but many times decided to continue living. Of course, some people, less than a million per year commit suicide, mostly due to mental health problems, relationship or financial crisis. 

The people who have chosen to die are in great minority anyway. It’s hard to find an exact number of failed suicide attempts. Not everyone will talk to authorities afterwards, and what counts as an suicide attempt anyway? One reasonable data point I could find is number of people who ended up in hospitals for injuries due to self-harm in the US. It’s about 12x higher than successful attempts. In my explanation this ratio would be much lower if people really wanted to kill themselves, so they were mostly confused and unsure. Most of them continued living happily ever after. Or at least they thought life to be better alternative than not life.

When hormones and neurotransmitters in the brain are balanced and relationships with other people and ourselves are thriving, there is no question whether we want to be alive or not. Of course we do. Life is great and every problem is a challenge we can overcome. How could not being be be prefered over this amazing mix of heart-warming feelings, sensible thoughts, unbreakable friendships, eternal happiness and cosmic love?

III.

Life is good when we feel like it and when we don’t there is an expectation that the feeling will come back soon. And we all live in these states of mind, otherwise we would simply end it. One could think of many motivations to continue living, but the intuition that life is worth living underlines it.

Problem of goodness, badness and value of life cannot be solved entirely objectively, our intuition can be guided, but not determined by facts and observations. Therefore we cannot be ever certain that life is objectively good. The word “good” in a moral sense is representation of subjectivity. What’s good for you might have bad effects on someone else. In the same way we cannot objectively prove the opposite, that life is bad. All we can do is to take the best guess according to our experience.

Uncertainty about the most basic questions goes all the way up to whatever problem one is trying to solve. It wouldn’t allow us go far in life if we thought whether life is worth living every single minute. We have a coping mechanism that allows us to put “I’m sure about this” tag on things we expect to be true. The problem is lack of effective control mechanism for overusing it and forgetting we used it in a first place. And that’s how we became overconfident about our thoughts, opinions and truths. 

It’s surprisingly hard to change your mind. To make it easier we could move from the world of certain truths and tightly held believes to the world of almighty uncertainty and always changing probabilities. Next step might seem little bit radical, we could assign very high probability that everything we believe is wrong in some way. It’ll make it much easier to update our believes when new evidence comes in. 

IV. 

Realization that we are thinking in a mental models can be helpful, because we know that all models are wrong, but some are useful. So why would anyone want to cling to a model, when it’s obviously imperfect? Everyone would happily go searching for useful mental models, exchanging notes and changing believes along the way. 

Easier said than done, I can attest, having trouble to internalize it even when I (sort of) understand it on a logical level.

Clearly one could find many benefits to being unmistakable right and overconfident in certain aspects. It feels good to simplify the world and maybe the only way to completely understand something is to create an illusion of understanding and believe it completely. We want to feel good about ourselves, it gives us motivation to continue living. If we accept all that uncertainty and never find absolute conclusion that our actions were good, why would we act at all? Why wouldn’t we add ourselves to the number of suicides?

It follows general pattern of learning about a problem:
I don’t know there is a problem. 
I know about existence of the problem, but nothing specific
There is a problem and It’s either A or B
I know the solution to the problem is A not B
What if it’s B? Is it even possible?
What if it’s A, B, not A and not B all at the same time
Oh no there is whole spectrum of possibilities between the A and B and all around them.
So as you already expect,
