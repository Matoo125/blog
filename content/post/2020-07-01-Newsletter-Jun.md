Another great month behind us and it's time for me to do my review of my habits and activities, and write a bit about what I found interesting. Actually, I want to talk about reviewing your habits for a while.

**I. Habits**

First of all, habits are extremely useful, since you are what you do, and habits are what you are actually doing on a daily basis, you are your habits. Most of us, without conscious efforts ends up with habits that are highly suboptimal, often actively harmful. Therefore making habit improvement your priority is essential for becoming the person you want to be. 

Few years ago, I was lucky enough to read Power Of Habit, the book that wants to take you from zero to hero in personal habit creation. It worked amazingly well on me, and I was able to create strong routines of reading, learning, sleeping, doing sports, eating healthy and working. And at the same time replaced many of the habits that were not supporting of my long term well being. 

Afterwards I continued to live my life keeping most of my good habits with slight changes from time to time. You can live a long time based on your past efforts, for example right now I have enough money in my bank account to live few years out of it without making any efforts in making more. This might be a great choice in some situations and it's much better to have the ability to choose than not. Sometimes it might be even beneficial for my financial, or long-term career satisfaction situation to take this choice, so I can spend my time learning something or doing the activity that will bring me closer to my goal.

Not sure whether I'm using meaningful analogy here, but let's say that focusing on developing habits is similar to making money. It gives you better means to do what you want in the future. But sometime it might not be a bottleneck. If your habits are good enough for your current situation and your goals, it might be as making more money even if it doesn't really move you closer to your goal. 

Okay I might have got a bit lost there. This is a long way of saying that I was not focusing on my habits for a long time (because they were working), but their power was somehow decreasing by time, and few months ago I ended up in a situation where felt, like I need to make a more ~~money~~ appropriate habits to my current situation. And I want to take it to a next level, by actively reviewing my habits once a month to see whether they fit, whether there is some way to change them to make them more useful, how do I feel about my previous changes, what are the areas I still feel like it's not as good as it could be, and so on.

**II. Reading**

One of the most important habits I dropped was reading. The medium is not as important, even the reading part is not super-essential to the goal of mine, but it seems to be one of the best ways to get the information. If I were to articulate my goal I would have a hard time to express myself, but it goes along the lines of "Gather more information about the world to understand it better, so that you can more skillfully navigate within". And that might happen in many ways, such as talking to people, or listening to podcasts. 

But text is a magical medium that allows you to go in depth, with the greatest minds of our time, without being worried of taking too much of their precious time. And it's something that I never wanted to stop doing, but it was pushed down the list of my priorities, until not much of it was left. Okay so I want to read, but also it's important not to loose the track of my true goal of having better understanding of the world to be a better human being. 

This brings me to the usual place of the need to prioritize and to pick my own battles. I won't have the time to read everything and choices are plenty. [todo how many books there are, how much time it would take to read etc. how much time i have in my life to read]. And most of the texts wouldn't give me much. So it's worth to spend some time choosing and exploring. One habit I want to create is to drop most of the books I start reading. This allows me to learn more about my preferences, but also about the choices out there.  

It's sounds obvious and easy in my ears, but to get over the emotional aspect of letting go is surprisingly hard. Maybe I'm creating there an unnecessary identifications, such as "I'm the kind of person who finishes what is started" or "who can read this book even if it's so hard I hardly understand, or boring because I lack context", or "only weak people give up, and by stopping I will display my inner weakness". I know it doesn't make much sense, but not dropping the books is irrationally difficult for me.

To overcome this tendency, I want to be careful not to make finishing something the goal. And always keep tracking - what is the best book (or any resource) I can read. This has one huge advantage of enjoying  the reading more, since there is nothing better to read than the book in your hands. And there are lot of great things to read, you know that because you dropped many of them, when you found something even more interesting. 

Also I don't want to sound like I'm making some absolute claims like one book is better than another. It's all situation and person dependent. What is your mood, energy level, knowledge, desire, and goal. The equation of perfect book is influenced by all these factors. Also feel free to replace book with any other source when you feel like it. Reading a carefully written blog post or book summary might be as fulfilling, useful and informative as anything else. 

One of the fears of not finishing the book is "what if by stopping now, I will miss something important, that will make the whole text come together and I will become much better person (smarter, etc.) ". There is a smart technique for situation as this one. Find the most interestingly sounding chapter and read it, even if it's the last one. It will either make you excited, or make your decision of dropping the book much easier.

**III. Meditation**

It's official, I dropped my goal of meditation 2 h every day, and my new aim is to keep 1 hour the whole summer, and maybe increase it back to 90 minutes or full two hours afterwards. This gives me the time to focus on my other goals, such as reading and writing, while staying reasonably social during this period. Also I might still meditate more if I want to. This change is important to keep the process delightful. And it still happens that I do full hourly session, because I just enjoy it so much. 

Meditation is closely connected with the rest of your life, and when you feel like something else is not as good as it should be, and there exists an activity you can do to make it better, it might feel forceful to meditate. So the number one priority for a good meditation is to live a good life, achieving your goals on time and trusting yourself that you can do what you want to do, because the moment you stand up from your meditation cushion, you will start working on the most important tasks and give them your full attention.

There might be many goals people want to fulfill by meditating. Being able to stay with feelings without running away seems to be one of the most important benefits for me. Forget enlightenment, that's for weak people with wishful thinking. Let's take control over our bodies, inner-states and our whole life. We are completely responsible for the way we behave. At least when we learn not to run away, we might become. 

People are often happy on the outside, but if you look more closely it's not that difficult to see that there is an conflict inside. There are parts that feel hurt, deceived, mistreated, lonely, unsuccessful, depressed, stupid, or other forms of not being enough. Inside every adult, there is an child inside, that has trouble to understand it's own needs, wants to be helped, and to signal this dissatisfaction, all it can manage to do, is to start crying or disconnect from the world.

 Looking inside can help with this. It slowly uncovers tendencies of our minds, so we can see them for what they are, often unhelpful mental patterns we learned when we were younger, that could be the best we were able to do at some point in out lives, but they got stuck inside of us and became unconscious. It's hard to recognize them as something we are doing to ourselves, if it's happening outside of our conscious awareness. But once we watch our mental processes enough to recognize these subtle movement, they become conscious again and we start to see our power to change them. 

**IV. EAGxVirtual**

It was a great conference, well done! To talk with interesting strangers after some time and have many interesting conversations, or quick icebreakers. Maybe I'm surprised how easy it was for me to talk with people. Part of it is that there is this shared interest, but anyway it seems to be easy for me to talk for an hour with people, and keep it interesting. 

I always thought I'm not talking to people because I'm introverted, and this is what we do. But as I'm finding more interesting people it seems to be much easier to just be myself and let it flow without much effort. There are many topics I want to talk about, and there are actually people who spent some time thinking about them deeply, and we can chat and throw our thoughts on each other, understand each others perspectives and become wiser. 

Anyway, if you are interested to talk, I'm always open to it, let's schedule something! Especially if you are interested in things I write about, EA, rationality techniques, introspection and so on. 

**V. Resources**

Probably the best thing last month for me was my engagement with [Focusmate](https://www.focusmate.com/), the application for coworking someone else who also want to work at the same time. The idea is simple, but powerful, it's surprising how large effect it can have on my focus and productivity, when I express my commitment to the other person, hear theirs, and see their focused face as they try to move one step closer towards achieving their goal. Also someone I get people who seem all over the place, but luckily I can hide them from my screen, block them for the future, and enjoy the working time with other driven individuals from all around the world. It also seems to provide benefits for my social well being, since working remotely for the past 7 months I don't engage with many people. Even though it's just nice 2 minutes at the start and at the end. It brings a new aspect to my days. I recommend it to anyone working remotely, even if you just work on writing a blog post after work, it might be helpful. 

**Podcasts**

Lex Fridman had some amazing podcast conversations I really enjoyed last month. At first, I listened to an older episode with [Stephen Wolfram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez773teNFYA), academic who used to work with Richard Feynman, left the academia to start an successful company to change the way we [talk with the computers](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) about the world, and now is trying to [revolutionize physics](https://www.wolframphysics.org/) with search for the fundamental theory. 

Then there was an episode [100 with his dad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JipQNWuYnA), Alexander Fridman, who is also an world class plasma physicist, child prodigy who was winning Olympiads in Russia, and ended up as the Professor in the USA. Many interesting stories, but it's also about their father-son relationship. It's quite unusual to see the son asking hard and personal questions to the father, both being vulnerable and honest. 

The last and maybe best one was the episode right after that - 101 with AI researcher [Joscha Bach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-2P3MSZrBM), who has A LOT of amazing thoughts, goes deep quickly, and is not afraid to think broadly about consciousness and intelligence. This might have been the best podcast I heard this year, it would be worthy to listen to it repeatedly, since I didn't manage to parse most of the content enough to fit my memory structure. Anyways if you want to hear thoughts of one of the best thinkers about cognitive systems, consciousness, and the world in general, this is your chance. 

Even his insight about meditation was surprisingly accurate. "Meditation is a bunch of techniques that help you control attention. It helps you to access your source code ". Or parts about our identity, and that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama makes sense, since the identity cannot die, when someone else takes it on. 

Podcast at 80 000 hours with [A. J. Jacobs](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/aj-jacobs-on-writing-reframing-problems-as-puzzles/) was unusual, but engaging. The conversation was not technical, it felt more like an outside perspective. 

Sam Harris talked with [James Clear](https://samharris.org/podcasts/200-creatures-habit/) about his book Atomic Habit, that was probably what made to think about habits on a meta-level again and make their development a priority again.

**Noteworthy**

Noteworthy is also [Connected Papers](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kjQXzkTGuixoJtQnq/we-ve-built-connected-papers-a-visual-tool-for-researchers) project that visualizes graphs of how research papers are connected to each other through citations. I want to explore it more, when I will have some time.

As everyone at least loosely connected to the rationality sphere knows, the Slate Star Codex blog was taken down by the author himself for his fear of loosing anonymity, since NY Times reporter wanted to publish his real name in the article about the blog. See this [petition](https://www.dontdoxscottalexander.com/) to find all relevant information, it was already signed by many influential people including Paul Graham, Steven Pinker, Jonathan Haidt, Sam Harris, Liv Boeree and Jaan Tallinn.

Liv Boeree is one of the best poker players in the world, she also founded organization fundraising for effective charities from other poker players, the Raising for Effective Giving. Obviously she is extraordinary smart, but also a great speaker and presenter. Now she started an [**youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC09fp6hZ2RHiUYwY8hNCirA) channel to popularize scientific topics. 

There was a short article [written in Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikbirkeneder/2020/06/01/do-crowdsourced-predictions-show-the-wisdom-of-humans/#3d63292d6d9d) about Metaculus. Also Facebook's experimental team created [MVP](https://www.forecastapp.net/) of application that seems surprisingly similar to our platform. The goal is to improve the quality of the discussion on the interned. I'd be happy, and surprised if it actually worked out and they made it one of their official products. 

David Roodman wrote an [blog post](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/modeling-human-trajectory) summarizing his more technical paper on OpenPhilantropy blog. It's called Modeling the Human Trajectory and it describes what happens if you extrapolate past economic growth into the future, why is not totally naive, and what can we learn from it. One of the best reads on the Internet.
