People are goal achievers and desire fulfillers. It's common across the animal kingdom, even plants have a goal of getting enough resource to survive and thrive, it optimizes to achieve. This process doesn't have to be on a conscious level. Genes can hide it, many unconscious processes can hide it, we don't even need any conscious part for it to work. 

Animals have many goals in the same way as animals do, and on top of that few of those goals might become part of consciousness. I have no idea about the consciousness across species, so let me focus on humans. We have usual goals such as getting enough food and water, being accepted as a part of the group, finding the partner for reproduction, having a power that can be used in time of crisis, not injuring ourselves. But they are easy to get in our society. 

We created an environment where it's easy, because we were really surprisingly good goal achievers.
