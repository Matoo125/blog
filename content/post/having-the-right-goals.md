People are goal achievers and desire fulfillers. It's common across the animal kingdom, even plants have a goal of getting enough resource to survive and thrive, it optimizes to achieve. This process doesn't have to be on a conscious level. Genes can hide it, many unconscious processes can hide it, we don't even need to have a conscious part. 

Animals have many goals in the same way as animals do, and on top of that some of those goals might become part of consciousness. I have no idea about the consciousness distribution across species, so let me focus on humans. We have usual goals such as getting enough food and water, being accepted as a part of the group, finding the partner for reproduction, having a power that can be used in time of crisis, not injuring ourselves. But they are relatively easy to get in our society. 

We created an environment where it's easy, because we are really surprisingly good goal achievers. We can get everything necessary without really trying. After achieving all of this, we didn't stop, but set different goals, since we like doing stuff, improving things and optimizing the world around. 

Some people are not aware, they have goals (at least they said it to me), many people are unsure about their goals and few people actually thought hard about setting the right goals.
