## Introduction
> *"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself â€” and you are the easiest person to fool."* Richard Feynman


I have been co-working with people online over the past two years. That's hundreds of hours of focused time with more than 100 people. Here are my main takeaways.

***If you are interested in co-working online with me please write me an email, or use this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfT1HB4COMFhguTnMoDH1fa0Nd6S7c8NA9AcDLJJ-4b94GlJg/viewform?usp=sf_link)***


## Benefits of co-working online

I consider it to be an underutilised, easy hack to boost your productivity. Some benefits you will get from top of my mind.

- Nice social interaction for remote workers
- Easier to maintain focus
- Forces you to work on what you want to work on
- Social accountability
- It can help you to focus longer without trying harder
- Raises your energy and makes your motivated to do things


## The main existing platforms

### Focusmate

- You work 50 minute sessions
- Check-in at the beginning - share your plan
- Check-out at the end - how did it go
- Has EA group (the main reason I go there)
- A lot of medicine and PhD students. 
- Some sessions can totally make your day
  - You can have really wonderful 5-minute conversation and be really productive the rest of the time
  - You meet people from all over the world during your workday
  - I enjoy asking PhD students about their thesis. They mostly love to talk about it.
  - People enjoy receiving pointed questions when you have a bit of shared context.
  - Some people start shining when you reveal a bit about yourself
- What are the problems
  - You are forced to change partner each hour.
  - You can very easily cancel the session
  - You can avoid scheduling sessions and nobody asks you what happened
  - Some sessions can be emotionally draining. 
  - If you don't like the person, it might break your flow

### Ultraworking

- Coworking zoom community that works 24/7
- What is nice about it?
  - Nice people, little community vibe
  - Dedicated moderator to keep the spirit high
  - Longer working periods with the same people
  - You see the same faces regularly
- What are the problems?
  - It has forced 30 minute sessions with moderated breaks
  - You cannot speak with people unless you are picked during speaker break
  - You can jump in only every two hours. That makes me mostly not jump in at all.
    - sometime they let you in in meantime, but it's not guaranteed

### Other platforms

- Gather town seems really cool, but it's mostly dead
- Zoomers seems to lack shared breaks, accountability is not strong enough

## FAQ

### What's wrong with in-person coworking?

- It's rare to see people doing shared sessions in real life for some reason.
- Asking each other how did it go? Are you focused on your task? Each half an hour might seem unusual to many people.
- It's much easier to distract each other, and just have fun.
- If you manage to do the above there is no reason it should not work in real life. 
- Imagine early SpaceX, they totally worked 80 hours week focused, pushing each other
- Culture like that is quite rare in most coworkings

### What if I'm not 2840 hours workweek type of person?

- that's okay, I think these techniques will help you as well
- I personally don't work much more than 40 hours per week as well

## What would be the ideal online coworking?

### Regular check-ins

- The awareness that in 30 minutes you need to tell the other person how did it go is powerful motivator.
- Check-ins are the most important part of the coworking. It reminds you that somebody is in the room with you and you both need to get shit done! 
- You don't want to let your good friend down, even if you work on totally unrelated projects, so you work hard, focused and energized.

### Longer periods, and/or familiar people

- The best solution I'm aware of is to find a couple of friends and work together longer sessions.
- I'm totally fine to work with strangers / future friends. It's important that we like each other
- Not sure whether 1-1 is better than larger group

### Optimal time

- 2 to 8 hours would be great
- Some people can work for hours without breaks with regular check-in. I'd like to try to try that at some point.
- Mostly I really like taking break each 30-60 min to walk and talk.
