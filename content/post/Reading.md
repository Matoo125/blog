Reading is magic. This document starts with brief exploration of my personal relationship with reading, followed by the most useful tips, and practical recommendations. 

## Personal experience with reading
I started to read quite late. Around 18 years of age. For unknown reason I never started to read in my native language, and my initial motivation to start reading was to exercise my english language, once I reached the point that I could actually read books without much struggle. 

Since then I slowly began to experiment with different kinds of literature. At first, almost everything amazed me and I didn't though much whether the book is worth reading, or what is the best way to learn this information. I spent hours browsing bookdepository, amazing bookstore that delivers cheap books without any fees to anywhere in the world. After I found titles I liked, ordered them, and waited few weeks for books to be delivered. 

The joy of opening the package and looking at these marvelous covers, feeling the weight, noticing the smell. Openning them to see the typography, table of content, length of chapters. I was already calculating how long will it take me to read through this, what is the best strategy. I read 1-2 hours a day, it was easy, it filled me with curiosity. The world became more interesting, there was logic, things made sense. I found the path I can walk on. I found the books I could trust.

Afterwards I had my ups and downs, transitioned to ebooks to embrace minimalism, and read through more than hunderd of books (My goodreads tracker says 150+). Cultivating this relationship for about 7 years, I learned a lot about the art of reading. It's not a race to maximize the number of books read, but rather a love relationship. Deep friendship developed through space and time. Friendship with authors, ideas, stories. Conversation that never stops.  


## The most important

### Many books simultaneously
One of my first insights of reading were that to get the most value out of it, I need to read many books at once. Ideally 4-6 so that I can switch between them according to my mood. This point can be easily overlooked and justified by the statement that "I can hardly finish reading once book". My experience is, that reading one book can be harder than reading 4 books. 

When reading one book, I often feel like I need time to digest, or it's not really relevant to my priorities right now. So I don't read, and that's totally normal. This limited perspective doesn't allow me to see that there are completely different worlds hidden in other books. By reading many books at once I'm able to always follow my curiosity and current needs.

Another unexpected benefit is that books offer different perspectives. Often after finishing couple of chapters from one book, I start reading second book, and get totally new insight on the text from the first book. This happens even when switching from a book about decision making, to a fantasy novel. Sometime I'm surprised that seemingly unrelated texts are offering me different perspectives on the same thing.

### Anything of interest
I have a tendency to prescribe myself books I should be reading. This often leads to full reading list of books that are difficult, above my level, or not engaging for some other reason. If there is no excitement to read it's hard to willfully force myself to do it. Even if I manage to do it once or twice, it's not sustainable.

Reading can be and should be joyful experience. Not necessarly every second of it, but it's useful to have it as a baseline. The trick is to read out of interest, not because you should read this and that. When I follow my curiosity, I'm completely immersed in the experience. 


I'll let Naval tell the rest, since he did it better than I could

> It almost doesn’t matter what you read. Eventually, you will read enough things (and your interests will lead you there) that it will dramatically improve your life. Just like the best workout for you is one you’re excited enough to do every day, I would say for books, blogs, tweets, or whatever—anything with ideas and information and learning—the best ones to read are the ones you’re excited about reading all the time.
 
 

> Read everything you can. And not just the stuff that society tells you is good or even books that I tell you to read. Just read for its own sake. Develop a love for it. Even if you have to read romance novels or paperbacks or comic books. There’s no such thing as junk. Just read it all. Eventually, you’ll guide yourself to the things that you should and want to be reading.

### Drop the books

My first year of intense reading, I finished every book I started. It worked well back then, since everything was new and exciting. Over the long-run this strategy is far from perfect. There is millions of books in existence. And every year there are more than 100k books are released in English language. 

> The number of books completed is a vanity metric. As you know more, you leave more books unfinished. Focus on new concepts with predictive power. - Naval Ravikant

In certain mindsets, dropping books feels like failing. That's a wrong view to have. Most likely it's not a good fit for me at this moment. World is large, there is no need to waste time with boring texts. I'm trying to teach myself that dropping books is winning. It's saving time and creating opportunity for better alternative. 

Harari once said (paraphrasing from memory)
> I drop most of the books I start reading. When I start reading a book I'm trying to figure out whether it's worth to continue. My attention is a limited and valuable resource so I finish reading maybe one out of ten books I start.

There are few strategies that can help with dropping books
- Read first paragraph and ask yourself question: Is this interesting enough to dedicate couple of hours of my life to it?
- Ask yourself the same question after each chapter
- Read the most interesting chapter first. Especially when talking about non-fiction books, it's not necessary to read page by page. There might be second to last chapter that seems the most interesting. We can jump there immediately. If that chapter is underwhelming, we saved ourselves a lot of time.
- Try multiple books before deciding. If you are aware what your options are, it's easier to make a good decision. Read several pages from multiple books and copare which of them are the most interesting. 
- Often the book is highly engaging at the beginning, but then it starts to repeat what you already know, or talk about stuff not relevant to you. Remember that you already god most out of the book. Scan the rest for interesting content, and then drop it. No matter what page you are on, it's always a good page to stop reading.



## Tools and optimization

### Keep track
I found it motivating to keep track of the books I read. It's possible to keep this information in a simple text document, or a spreadsheet. For my current purposes the Goodreads works well. It allows me to keep track of "want to read", "currently reading", and "read" categories, rate the books, and review them. The data is easily exportable. 

Prioritization is a bit more difficult. I don't have any great solution here. If you have some good ideas, please contact me [direct@matejv.com].

### Audiobooks
I find audiobooks highly valuable. Especially on days when I'm unable to find that much time to read, or I'm tired from work and cannot sit anymore. I have to learned to do all kinds of activities while listening, such as walking, riding a bicycle, cleaning, cooking, falling asleep. 

For some people this limited attention could be a problem. One cannot completely focus on a book while doing other activity. In my experience this is true, but it's not necessarly a problem. Some books don't require my full attention and in fact I can enjoy them more while doing other activities. 

My favourite audiobooks are biographies, or fiction can be really well recorded. Though most of the audiobooks I listened to is general non-fiction that is often not ideal in this format, and it was worth it anyway.

The essential feature of any spoken audio-content is the ability to adjust speed. Don't be afraid to go 2x, or even 3x. Any speed that suits your needs in the moment is the correct one. The content should feel engaging. If it's not you might speed up, or slow down. If you understand less than 80%, it's probably too fast, otherwise too slow. This definitely changes across different recordings, or even during the same one.

### Text to speech
I was surprised to figure out that stunning progress was made in text-to-speech technology in recent years. The high-tech voices trained by deep learning offered by Google, Amazon, and others are cheap and accessible. The quality though still not perfect is sometimes even better that human voice in my opinion. The free voices are good enough, especially when listening on larger speed 2x-3x.

### Read while listening and adjust the speed
If nothing else, try this technique. It was a game-changer for me. After repeatedly failing to find the beauty of speed reading, I was listening to the podcast [link] where this technique was mentioned. By engaging two senses stmultaneously it's possible to increase the focus. By decreasing mind-wandering it's possible to fully engage with the content. Here is how to do it
- use audiobook, or TTS
- open your book (it's good to use electronic book and make the fonts and margins smaller, so that you don't need to move your eyes so much. That allows you to increase the reading speed to 3x)
- adjust the speed to understand 80%-90% of the content. This step is really important to keep you in the zone. If it's too easy to understand the mind will start wondering. If you understand everything, you are not stretching yourself. If you understand too little, you will be lost and confused.
- if you want to relax go slowly, that's ok too

> However, certain things have not changed in the last thirty years. One constant is that, to achieve all the purposes of reading, the desideratum must be the ability to read different things at different—appropriate—speeds, not everything at the greatest possible speed. As Pascal observed three hundred years ago, “When we read too fast or too slowly, we understand nothing.”
Charles van Doren, How to Read a Book (A Touchstone Book), loc. 151-154

### Ebook reader
One of the best purchases I have ever made. Books are heavy and take a lot of space. If you have stable home, this might not be an issue and having a full library is cool. 

There are people who can read thousand pages long books on their phones. I'm not one of them. My eyes need a rest from the screen. 

Cheapest models for $100 are more than enough.


## What other people said

### Naval Ravikant

Don't be afraid of any books and study foundations
> It’s much more important today to be able to become an expert in a brand-new field in nine to twelve months than to have studied the “right” thing a long time ago. You really care about having studied the foundations, so you’re not scared of any book. If you go to the library and there’s a book you cannot understand, you have to dig down and say, “What is the foundation required for me to learn this?” Foundations are super important.

Love for reading is superpower
> The genuine love for reading itself, when cultivated, is a superpower. We live in the age of Alexandria, when every book and every piece of knowledge ever written down is a fingertip away. The means of learning are abundant—it’s the desire to learn that is scarce.
