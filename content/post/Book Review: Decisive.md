## Book Review: Decisive 

We make hundreds of decisions every day. Hurricane of questions is going through our minds before opening our eyes in the morning. 

*   Do I want to wake up now, or in 5 minutes?
*   Should I meditate now, or after cleaning my teeth?
*   What clothes will I wear today?

As you can see, not all decisions are the most important ones we need to make in our lives. But it's unclear how to decide which are the most important. It’s hard to know how much effort should be invested into making them, and often unintuitive to make them well.

Decisions are all around us, and we cannot avoid making them. Even if we outsource the decision to someone else - we make a decision not to make a decision and it doesn’t have to be the right one. We need to learn how to make good decisions, otherwise we will end up going with the flow, living an average life. 

This might seem slightly overwhelming but keep with me. There are simple tools and mental models that can help you become a much better decision-maker, once you start implementing them. Our mistakes are easy to see, once someone points them out. But the ultimate decision is up to you. Are you ready to start making better decisions?

Chip and Dan Heath decided to write the book Decisive, a guide for making better decisions, that is well written, but as it's often the case with self-help books, full of anecdotes, that are nice to read about but won't necessarily help you to actually change your behavior.

This review, or rather a brief summary of main ideas and tools combined with my personal experience, should be enough to get you a sufficient understanding of the material so that you can use your valuable time well and start applying these strategies in your own life.

In this review you will learn

*   What are four villains of decision making and how can we overcome them
*   What are some practical tools for better decision making
*   How can you apply them in your life

Each section will introduce one villain with recommended tools for overcoming them. All the techniques and main ideas are from the book. The original text is quoted. Most of the main text is me playing around with the key ideas by applying them to my life. 

If you are short of time, I recommending you reading the first part "Narrow Frame" and skim the other parts for something interesting. 

*As someone who enjoys independent thinking and has a strong desire to live the best life possible, I’m writing this review as a part of my attempt to explain useful ideas around rationality. I want to develop a more nuanced understanding of the material for myself by explaining it to others.  Hopefully I’ll become a better source of information and useful advice for others.  Ultimately, the goal is for everyone to be better off, and live an amazing life.*


## The four villains of decision making


### Narrow frame

Most of our decisions are whether or not decisions. We rarely consider more than two options and often limit ourselves to the two sides of the same coin. By avoiding alternatives will limit the space of opportunities and that makes it harder to reach a satisfying outcome. 

*   _Should I stay in my current job or leave?_
*   _Should I keep my current relationship or break up?_
*   _Should I eat the cookie, or not?_

First villain is surprisingly common, and on a bright side, easy to overcome. We need to mindfully watch for “_should I do A or B” _ sentence structure in our minds, or while speaking with someone. Noticing this will raise our alarm of narrow framing. The problem is not well defined. 

To counteract the first pitfall of decision making, we need to widen our options. Try to think AND instead of OR. The space of possibilities is large, so don’t limit yourself with obvious choices and try to brainstorm alternatives. 

Think about your goals, they are often pushed to the background when we feel there is a decision to be made between two possibilities. False dilemma is hard to solve.  It’s impossible to make the right decision, because we forgot to consider it in the first place. 

It’s helpful to ask questions as:

*   _Is there a solution that satisfies both A and B?_
*   _Is there some third possibility that would satisfy my needs better?_
*   _What would I do, if none of my current options were no longer available?_
*   _What is my true goal here? And is there some better way of achieving it?_
*   What is my opportunity cost? What else could I do?

Examples from the book

> _When the executive board considered more than one alternative, they made six times as many “very good” decisions. (Specifically, 40% of the multi-option decisions were rated “very good,” compared with only 6% of the “whether or not” decisions.)_

> _It’s not just teenagers and business executives who fall into this trap; it’s all of us._

> _In interviews we conducted for this book, we had conversations with three people who were facing similar dilemmas. Two were wondering whether to quit their jobs, and the third was wondering whether to quit her relationship. All three of them, asked to state their options, saw only a binary choice: I’m trying to decide whether or not I should leave. (Here’s hoping the “whether or not” phrase made you roll up your decision-adviser sleeves.)_

It happens to me that I have some problem that seems impossible to solve. It might be something simple as “I want to be closer to this person. Should I write to her or not?”. Then I start to think “what should I write?”. And get stuck. On the first step or any other step in the process. I find a question that seems like something I need to solve, but don’t know how. 

In situations like these, it really helps me to remember that [problems are fixable](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-7-problems-are-for-fixing). And start to brainstorm the solution. It’s surprising to see how often 5 minutes of brainstorming is enough to give me multiple possible ways to approach my problem. Or maybe I realize that there are better questions I could be asking. And I need to redefine my problem. 


### Confirmation bias

Sometimes, rather than making a decision, we want to find supporting evidence for doing what we already want.  We create a false sense of certainty  by simply ignoring the contrary evidence. This selective process makes us feel justified about our choices. We did our research, found the evidence, we know. 

Overcoming the second villain is harder, but anyone can do it. These are three main tools recommended by the authors. 

*   consider the opposite
*   zoom out before zooming in
*   test your assumptions

Let’s look at them in a bit more detail.


#### Consider the opposite

One helpful exercise is to consider the opposite of your current stance. How would the world look if the opposite of what you currently think were true? Yes, I know. It’s challenging. 

Imagine that you believe in god. You see all the difficulties on the earth and feel there has to be something more. Otherwise many things would stop making sense. Your life wouldn’t make sense to you. Now try to consider that there is no god, no afterlife, nothing more. It’s a scary experiment that almost kept you empty, but then you remember your experience of higher realms, of people who were in touch with god. Everything makes sense again, and now you have _successfully_ considered the opposite, yay! 

The same might happen with people who don’t believe in god. Also in any other domain. You might believe in 

*   some claim about sleep you read once in the book
*   the safety or danger of driving a car
*   benefits of meditation
*   what kind of food is appropriate to eat, and so on. 

All of the above are recent examples of:_ where I failed to consider the opposite, and always found vague justification for my initial beliefs. _I bet anyone could think of a similar list on their own. Questions below can help you start. Seriously, give it a try.

*   In which of your beliefs it’s difficult for you to consider the opposite?
*   Can you remember some situations, where you have been exposed to different beliefs, and you thought, this has to be wrong, without actually considering it?


#### Zoom out, before zooming in

Our situation seems special, unique and irreplaceable. In some way it is, but in many ways it’s not. Whatever our problem, there are probably plenty of people who thought about it. Tips, best practices, tutorials, or even textbooks are ready for those who are willing to look. Who would think that we can make better decisions, just by reading about it, averaging, and believing in the wisdom of the crowd?

In fact, many of us do. Authors begin the chapter by explaining how using online review services became a second nature to us.

> _Many people have come to take this kind of review shopping for granted.... It’s an obvious thing to do, right? But this “obvious” behavior shows wisdom. Because when we make decisions based on reviews, we are acknowledging two things: (1) Our ability to glean the truth about a product is limited and subject to distortion by the company that makes it; and (2) For that reason, we are smarter to trust the averages over our own impressions._

That’s actually pretty impressive. People are showing signs of wisdom and humility. The problem starts when in much more important situations. When the stakes are high we do the opposite. Ignore the wisdom of the crowd and prefer our impressions over the averages.

> _For example, many people will accept a new job without consulting a sample of people who currently or formerly held the same title. Shouldn’t their “reviews” be as valuable as a stranger’s assessment of a hotel room or restaurant?_

Taking an outside view (or in other words zooming out), is not new to us. We want to know what happened to others in similar situations. Understand what are the important factors and how do people with relevant experience think about the issue.

Well, at least sometimes. Many of us have a strange tendency to avoid objective research when facing critical life decisions.  It might seem too personal to trust the data. Who knows, what important nuances are left out. I’m clearly distinct from an average person represented by the data. 

> *The advice to trust the numbers isn’t motivated by geekery; it’s motivated by humility. We can’t lose sight of what the numbers represent: A lot of people like us—people full of passion for their opportunities—spent their time trying something very similar to what we’re contemplating. To ignore their experience isn’t brave and romantic—“I’m not going to let some analysis stand in the way of doing what I believe.” Rather, it’s egotistical. It’s saying, We set ourselves apart from everyone else. We’re different. We’re better.*

We have specific circumstances, no doubt about that. After we manage to avoid jumping into the inside view right away, it is helpful to think about differences between our situation and the standard one. Take advantage of our unique information and perspective and achieve our goals.

*   How is my situation the same and how is it different from others?


#### Test your assumptions

Test every big decision before committing. We won’t buy a car before testing it. Approaching head-on much larger life decisions. Many of us study for degrees without ever testing whether we would like to do the job. Commit to a relationship without giving it a trial period. Or even smaller things, like buying gym membership without trying out a few times. Deciding to finish reading a book before you even know whether you like it. We create too much pressure on ourselves early on. The process will make us unhappy and unsuccessful.

Testing things can be easier than trying to predict the answer beforehand. Often we don’t have enough information and it can be gained easily by running tests. For example I can spend hours considering whether someone will want to go out with me or not. Whether I will like some event, book, or food. The problem is that I don’t have enough information, and can gain so much by trying it, that the answer will be obvious to me. My analysis won’t tell me much, when I don’t have [enough data](http://acritch.com/be-empirical/).

*   _Why do I think my assumptions are true?_ 
*   *What is the supporting evidence and how strongly it holds?* 


### Short-term emotions

Emotions make our lives rich and colorful. But they can also limit our perspective by making us focused on non-significant details. They are our instinctive way of predicting the future. Often badly calibrated.

> *But we are not slaves to our emotions. Visceral emotion fades. That’s why the folk wisdom advises that when we’ve got an important decision to make, we should sleep on it. It’s sound advice, and we should take it to heart. For many decisions, though, sleep isn’t enough. We need strategy.*

**_10/10/10_**

One helpful strategy is called 10/10/10. It works by thinking about our decisions in three different time frames: 

*   How will I feel about it in 10 minutes? 
*   How about 10 months?
*   And 10 years?

It’s a helpful way of **attaining distance** before deciding. Let’s consider a simple example.  _I’m interested in a girl, let’s call her Marry, and wonder whether it’s mutual.  There are reasons to think both ways. I really want to find out, but it’s kind of scary. Should I get in touch with this Marry? _Let’s imagine I do it and write her a message. 

How will I feel about it 10 minutes from now? Most likely, I’ll be a bit nervous and uncertain, but also excited and proud of myself. At least now I’ll figure out whether continuing to think about her romantically is worth my attention. 

How about 10 months from now? We could go on a date, maybe we are still together. We either had a nice experience, or she refused and that sucked for a while. But soon it helped me to focus and put my energy into my other relationships. I found a girl who actually was looking for someone like me. And we had a great time together. I’m really happy I wasn't controlled by my fear. 

How do I feel about it in 10 years? There is no way this potential refusal matters to me in 10 years. What’s the best thing that could happen? I have found a close friend, collaborator, or business partner. Maybe we are living together right now. Or there is a nice memory floating through my mind. How we got to know each other better, helped each other out, danced together, or exchanged a few kind messages. In any case. It helped me to move on.

**Intel story**

Richard Grove was the president of Intel during 1985 when he faced a company-changing decision.  Unfamiliar to most of us, Intel’s business was consisting mainly of computer memory. In fact it was the only manufacturer in the world for some time. Around 1980 a strong competition from Japan started to arise. 

Japanese were getting better and better and took a significant portion of market share for themselves. Customers were bragging about the quality of their products. At the same time researchers at Intel developed another product - microprocessors. 

Interest in this new product was increasing, with large clients as IBM coming on board. Slowly it became much more profitable, and they had trouble to match their competitors in quality of memories.  Intel’s leadership started to have heated discussions about what they should do. 

One camp advocated for doubling on memory production, a product that was already losing money, by building better factories that cannot be matched by anyone else. Others wanted to focus more on special markets. Then one evening Grove was discussing the issue with Intel’s CEO Gordon Moore, both were tired by internal deliberations. Then Grooved asked:

> “If we got kicked out and the board brought in a new CEO, what do you think he would do?”

> *Gordon answered without hesitation, “He would get us out of memories.”*

> *I stared at him, numb, then said, “Why shouldn’t you and I walk out the door, come back in, and do it ourselves?”*

Questions to ask to attain distance before deciding

*   What would my successor do?
*   What would I advise my best friend to do?
*   How would I feel about this decision in 10/10/10 (minutes/months/years)?


### Overconfidence

Everyone is a better driver than the average. Except me, since I don’t have a driver's licence. On the other hand I’m definitely a better person than average. Most of us assume that we know more (or are better) than we really do. Simply said, we are overconfident.

Nobody knows what will happen in the future, but we make guesses all the time. I exercised and ate a lot of vegetables today. Part of the reason is that I have made a prediction to live in forty years and benefit from these choices. But have I considered all the possibilities?

> *Fighting overconfidence means we’ve got to treat the future as a spectrum, not a point.*

Let’s take the advice from the authors and define a spectrum of possibilities. If nothing goes horribly wrong, I expect to live between 60 and 100 years. That's plenty of time to be influenced by the food I eat today. 

What if my life will end much earlier? That’s also possible and it shouldn’t be ignored. In that case my effort would be mostly wasted and I’d be better off enjoying myself. At the same time, it’s possible that medical advances and genetic therapies will allow me to live longer. Maybe 120 years. 

Considering these possibilities helps me to think about uncertainty in hand. I still tend to be overconfident and enjoy considering the upper end much more. In other scenarios I might be overconfident in the lower end of the spectrum.  For example, that I definitely won’t get this job. 

One recommended technique is to imagine that my plan had failed. Then ask myself the question: _Why did it fail?_ and try to come up with many plausible explanations. This is the risk I should be willing to take and if possibly try to overcome. 

Let’s try to implement it. _I died when I was 30 years old_. Kind of sucks, but let’s go with it. _What happened? _Maybe I drowned while trying to swim through some lake. Or I was hit by a car when riding a bike. Possibly I got a drivers licence and got myself into a bad accident. 

It’s all scary, but it feels surprisingly realistic. I know that kinds of things can happen. Being aware of the risk can help me to avoid it. It reminds me of Free Solo climber [Alex Honnold](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Alex_Honnold) who imagines how each step can be a deadly mistake when climbing a rock. Then he doesn’t do the moves that lead to dying.

Another problem is when we are not even aware there is an important decision to be made. We go with the flow, and avoid consideration. New decisions  happen mostly on autopilot.

> *In life, we spend most of our days on autopilot, going through our usual routines. We may make only a handful of conscious, considered choices every day. But while these decisions don’t occupy much of our time, they have a disproportionate influence on our lives. The psychologist Roy Baumeister draws an analogy to driving—in our cars, we may spend 95% of our time going straight, but it’s the turns that determine where we end up.*

How can we avoid the autopilot and identify these important moments? One possibility is to regularly reflect on questions you care about. 

*   Is there some better job I could be doing?
*   Am I fulfilled by this relationship?
*   How do I feel about my financial situation?

We can also use more generic questions:

*   Is it going according to plan?
*   If not, why not?
*   What could go better?

Alternatively we can identify specific triggers. 

*   When it’s 11pm I should seriously ask myself what I want to do now
*   After reading a book chapter, ask myself whether it’s worthy to continue
*   When not exercising for a week, ask myself what can I do about it


> *Sometimes the hardest part of making a good decision is knowing there’s one to be made.*


To conclude this part: We can overcome our overconfidence by thinking about the full spectrum of possibilities instead of a single point. Imagining bad, and good scenarios and making sure we can handle them. And planning to actually make the decision when needed, instead of letting the autopilot run our lives. 

> *The humble approach is to ask, “What can I reasonably expect to happen if I make this choice?” Once we accept the answer—and trust it to make our decision—then we can turn our attention to fighting the odds.*


### Conclusion

This book Decisive presents a clear structure. It’s main focus are 4 problems with decision making and techniques to overcome them. As most of the books in the pop-science-business genre it’s full of stories. How different companies and individuals faced a decision and either made them well or not. 

If you are interested in that you might value reading this book. If ideas and techniques mentioned in this review are familiar to you, you probably won’t. For practical shortcut authors provide nice additional resources on their website. Including this [workbook](https://heathbrothers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/HBDWB.pdf). 

First we learned that number one mistake when making decisions is not considering your options. If nothing else, try to avoid binary thinking and remember to widen your options. Second we look for supporting evidence of what we already think is true instead of considering the opposite, zooming out before zooming in, and testing our assumptions.

Third, our short-term emotions tempt us to make short-sighted choices. But we can attain distance by considering what other people would do in our situation. Or following 10/10/10 exercise. And lastly we are overconfident. It’s helpful to think in spectrums instead of a single scenario and prepare for both success and failure.

We can learn to make better decisions by overcoming our natural tendencies. 


### Bonus: Kahneman story

Thinking about the base rate is a common first heuristic when predicting the future. We want to know how often something happened in the past. Or even better what is the trend over time. And simply derive the probability of some outcome in the future. 

Be aware that people, including experts can be pretty bad at making predictions. They all are influenced by the same biases. But experts can be great at estimating base-rates. They understand the past well. 

> _This was something Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel Prize–winning psychologist, experienced himself early in his career. He and his colleagues were exploring the idea of writing a high-school textbook on the subject of judgment and decision making. They would be the first to develop curricula on those subjects, so they roped in the dean of the School of Education, who was a curriculum expert, to work with them. The team began to write some sample chapters, and they met every Friday to review their progress. One Friday, they were discussing research about how groups think about the future, and it occurred to Kahneman that they should take their own advice. He said, “Let’s see how we think about the future.”_

> _He asked his colleagues to write down the date when they thought the textbook would be completed. The range of estimates was quite narrow—everyone’s projections, including Kahneman’s and the dean’s, ranged from 1.5 to 2.5 years into the future. Then Kahneman suddenly recalled the idea of base rates from his statistics training, so he asked the dean whether he could recall other groups similar to theirs that had written a new curriculum from scratch. The dean said, yes, he could remember quite a few of them. Kahneman asked him to quantify the base rate: How long did it take them to finish?_

> _After some back-and-forth, two disturbing facts had surfaced. One: According to the dean, 40% of the groups never finished writing the curriculum. Two: Of the groups that did finish, all of them took seven to ten years. Then Kahneman asked the dean, “How does our group compare to the others?” (Note that he’s trying to see whether there’s any reason to adjust their prediction up or down from the base rate, based on the group’s skill.) The dean replied, “Below average, but not by much.”_

> *The curriculum took eight years to write.*
