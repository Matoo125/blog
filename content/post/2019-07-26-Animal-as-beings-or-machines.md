So far I mostly wrote about motivation and shared some of mine meta thoughts. Enough of that, now it's time to get into the meat of it.  I'm literally going to write about meat, beings which have it integrated in their bodies, and the meaning of it all.

Abuse of animals on factory farms is one of the biggest challenges we are facing today. They are sentient beings with ability to feel pain. We have no way of knowing how does pain feels for them and how different is their consciousness from ours. Actually that's slightly misleading, even though we are far from certain, there is a lot of evidence pointing into particular direction. 

Animals are not humans, but humans are animals. Since Darwin came with the theory of evolution, we know, that the difference between us is not a matter of kind, but of a degree. Pain is one of the oldest phenomenon, it seems to be present in fish, crabs, octopuses and everything above. Some facts, such as existence of opioid receptors are pointing even further and include insects, mollusks and  nematodes. 

My claim is that pain is an objective phenomenon, even though we have hard time to measure it as such. In case of humans we ask questions, such as "How painful does it feels on a scale 0 to 10?", and get the answer, "I guess it's about 6 and a half", then do some pain statistics, and create knowledge about pain. Animals have hard time answering this type of linguistic questions, so you know, "who cares about their experience?". Unfortunately our inability to measure pain directly does not make it go away. 

Animals are giving us plenty of signals we can measure. 

> If the animal stops activities that it habitually  performs in  conditions that might  be  supposed  to produce pain, if it learns how to avoid such conditions, and if it has parts of its nervous system dedicated to avoidance of damage, then there are grounds for worrying that it might feel something.  And these concerns are made much more acute if it has a large brain relative to its body and shows some of the cognitive capacity seen in humans.

There are reasons for dismissing objective existence of the pain, for example it might be decreased by placebos, hypnosis or acupuncture. Cultural differences are influencing our pain threshold and tolerance. Our expectations also play a role. And most importantly people perceive standard stimulus differently. Clearly, perception of the pain can be influenced by many conscious and unconscious processes. But if it's there, it still hurts.

II.

Pain itself might not be so bad by itself as the suffering it creates. It's just a signal that something is not right, managed in dedicated part of the brain, to help us avoid repetitive harmful behavior. This evolutionary feature is helping animals, not to bleed out, and pause before our bones are broken. It's something in the real world we can define quite clearly. But suffering is much more abstract, there has to be this perceiving entity that is conscious of the pain and doesn't want it to be present. 

When this conscious self (or I) is not satisfied with reality, a suffering arises. So when people subscribe to Descartian believes of non-human animals as machines, that are quite similar to us, but without the conscious observer with magical rational powers, it is sensible to believe they cannot suffer. They can feel pain, but not the suffering, similar to experienced meditators, who after decades of practice silenced the talk-show in their heads, and are perceiving the reality of the present moment non-judgmentally. 

There is famous photograph of an Vietnamese monk, who burned himself alive while meditating calmly, his consciousness at peace. This is what happens when you control your consciousness, you have a choice to respond to a stimulus, even if it's extremely strong, such as your whole body on fire. People without long training are not able to achieve this level of equanimity. It's enough to look at others, who self-immolated, most likely running around or rolling on the ground. 

Burned animal would behave as an untrained human. Panicking and unable to control itself. But the difference is, some people would say, that it only acts on the strongest stimulus, without consciousness that can make choice, if trained. It can be trained, but only mechanically, responding to rewards and punishments. While humans posses this soul-ish like consciousness that oversees the whole process underneath, and has nearly infinite value in comparison to lesser beings. 

This raises a question: Is there a point of critical distinction in the nature of consciousness, that makes people able to suffer and other species not? It's relevant and important to answer this question, because it tells us whether we should care about their pain, or not. 

For most people to start believing in animal suffering, it's enough to have a dog. To see personality, emotions, moods, memory, definitely a a living being that can feel pain and suffer. For sure, differences between people and dogs are quite large in some aspects. They posses smaller and much less developed brains, their ability for abstract and complex thinking is far behind ours. Those are points of critical distinctions.

Suffering can be caused by different things, simply put in two categories:  immediate physical pain (IPP) and emotional pain (EP). It's implausible we can deny the IPP to animals. EP is much more open to discussion, at least some aspects of it. Cows can get highly depressed after calves are taken away, typically 24 hours after birth, and mourn for days. But she doesn't think much about how well off are the cows on the best organic farms. Or how she could make a different decision 2 years ago, make her way to the front of the line, and end up connected to the newer version of a milking machine. 

Inability (or at least significantly reduced ability) to travel mentally through time is considered to be critical difference. It's plausible that we (humans) can badge ourselves with unique pain feeling ability. Now imagine some big physical pain from your past. Maybe you had tooth inflammation, appendicitis, broken bones, or something else. After you finished, remember the last time you experienced your FOMO or just got jealous at someone on your favourite social network. What do you think, was the second suffering that much worse? Probably not.

We cannot tell, how exactly does pain feels for them. It's hard enough, if not impossible to imagine how your own brain feels under the influence of mind altering substance, such as marijuana or LSD, if you never tried it (or anything with similar effect). And trying to understand how does animal feels from the inside, should be much harder task. But by observing animals, in the same way, we can observe people high on drugs, it's possible to notice many facts about their experience, such as what kind of emotions they feel. Even though we have no way of knowing how exactly, it's felt from the inside. 

We should be much more cautious.
