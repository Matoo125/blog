## Introduction

this document talks about my financial situation, goals and relationship with finance.

## Personal Background
My family is middle-class Slovakian family from a small town where you can easily live on 500 EUR/month. My parents had a bicycle store, and earned above average during good times (with slowly decreasing returns as it became harder to compete with largest stores). 

They lived frugally and saved significantly more than earned. That allowed them to retire 10-15 years early, purchase new car with cash when old one was stolen, invest into local real estate (since they didn't understand markets), sponsor my sister's college in Copenhagen (that is significantly more expensive city).

My mother was in charge of finance and did all the accounting for small business as well as for the family. She was originally high-school math and physics teacher and even though (as she says) she forgot all the advanced math she was still comfortable and good with numbers. Well good enough that we never had money issues and ended up with savings. 

These are not large amounts if you are from the UK, USA, or similarly rich country. Net worth similar to yearly entry level salaries at top tech companies. But for small Slovakian city it gave us important optionality. 

I have learned some of this frugality from my parents. My grandmothers, aunt and uncle were giving me 10-50 euros on birthdays and christmas. This way I managed to save over several years ~500eur to purchase my first computer. Given that I was about 12 years old back then it was a strong machine with 4 core 2.5GHz CPU. My IT teacher didn't want to believe me that I have such a strong computer and at first thought I confused some parameters. 

Later I became worse at saving, or at least my spending needs increased and I wasn't able to save anymore. I have spent most of my time until I started working with net worth about zero, which is not unusual of course.

Once I started earning I became super-rich over-night. That means I had about 650 EUR net income / month. But my spending was not more than 100 EUR/month since I lived with my parents, cooked all food at home (mostly purchased by my parents) and didn't party at all. My largest expense was 60 EUR / month train ticket and books. That means I saved at least 500 eur per month. I have actually managed to save 6k EUR my first year. Looking back that was quite cool accomplishment. 

Then I took another job in far away city with net salary 1500 EUR / month. This was significant increase, but I knew that it's much easier to spend money than to make them, so I kept my caution around spending. 

The largest expense in the city is rent. So I decided to cut it in half and rent shared room instead of private. Many people with my budget would take 1+kk for 600 eur or room for 400 (which would be totally reasonable). But I was embracing minimalism to the fullest and why would I need full room for myself anyway. 

My first year in Prague I paid rent 200 EUR/month. I think it was really great. My roommate was amazing he introduced me to vipassana. He was one of the most serious practitioners I have ever met as well as very kind and humble person. 

I kept cooking all my food and didn't increase much any other expenses. That allowed me to live on ~400 EUR/month. Saving about 12k EUR my first year in Prague, increasing my net worth to 18k EUR.

This trend continued, every year my salary got significantly increased and my spending increased with it, but never too much. I started to pay rent for a full room, eat out in restaurants, travel, take uber when needed, etc. Mostly in service of saving time, increasing productivity or optionality.

My housemate who rented me my first full room is investing enthusiast, so I started investing as well. Slowly moved all my assets into financial markets. At first it was quite fun, I enjoyed researching companies and buying stocks. I made 100% + on many of my stock picks during my first 2 years, but that was mostly due to lucky timing rather than a skill. 

My stock picking habit became slowly unsustainable and was taking me more time than I would want to. So I decided to create system that allows me to spend 10min/month on investing and feel comfortable with it. It took few iterations, but it works and was very helpful. (more detail below)

Thanks to my increased salary and lucky investments my net worth grew significantly over past few years. It's not cash though and if it falls down 50% I will understand and buy some more. (more about investing below)

When I look at tech salaries for comparable work I'm doing at top US/UK companies (link here todo), I realise there is a lot of room for salary increase. Not sure how much I care about that anymore. Probably very little. But it tells me one important fact. It's very unlikely that my main limitation would be lack of finance. I enjoy living frugally. I can live on 200-600 EUR / month if needed. I can make 10x-30x as much if needed.

This is interesting problem I have started noticing when I reached my financial security (~12k runaway). Everybody dreams about having enough money to only do what they enjoy, but how easily can you update when it actually happens? I think it already happened to me, but takes time to realise.

## Resources and optionality

Two important things to remember are
- increasing optionality is good
- resources can be exchanged and balanced


Money have a very interesting property. They can be flexibly exchanged for other resources and services. It's always better to have more money since they give us optionality. Even if all you do is that you give away all your money to a single foundation, having them in the first place gave you option to do so among thousands of other options. Optionality is always valuable.

Other things can increase optionality as well. For example learning new skills, or traveling to new countries can increase my optionality and costs money. Often it's better to invest into yourself, rather than stocks.

We dance with opportunity cost as we increase our optionality. What are the best ways to invest and how the resources can be used. There are many strategies one could follow, two extremes are
- save everything so you have optionality to pay for thing later
- spend everything now so that you increase your non-financial optionality (skill, network, etc.)

two more options
- you can give away to give optionality to others, this is purely altruistic act and you won't get rewarded by increased optionality.
- buy stuff that won't increase optionality of nobody because they make you happy for a bit

Money are one type of resource, but there are many others. For example: time, skills, knowledge, enthusiasm, health, family, community, world, environment can be all seen as resources. My goal is to balance these out and invest into biggest opportunities. For example:
- when I'm lacking sleep it's better to invest into sleep than into making more money (unless I have very good opportunity to make money now of course).
- when I lack energy I might need to invest into exercise or socializing, or better diet
- when I'm billionaire who already bought everything twice my best investment opportunities probably are in the improving the world sphere. 
- when I lack in meaning I might need to invest into family, community or world

The idea here is that resources can be exchanged. Not only money for stuff, but resource for resource. Money and time are generally very flexible. Skill, knowledge, relationships can be leveraged and are worth investing into. Often the best opportunities are outside of ourselves (investing into others).

## Investing
Note that I'm far from investing experts. I spent some time trying to understand basics so that I feel comfortable investing majority of my capital.

The basic idea is that having cash in bank is not "avoiding to play the game", or being "safe", but rather paying for flexibility to use money in near future. Because of the inflation value of money is decreasing 1%-3% or more if [things go wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation#Notable_hyperinflationary_periods). 

Other assets such as stock, ETFs or real estate can be less flexible but they tend to go up in value above inflation rate. This is not the case in every point in time, there can be years or even decades when the value goes down. 

Keep it mind that the whole point of money is to spend them in exchange to other things you care about. The point of investing is to wait for good opportunities to use your resources.

Money are easy to gasp and you can clearly see that higher numbers are better, but it's dangerous because of this simplicity. It can lead to gathering more and more because it's easy and fun. Such as many tech investors who feel super-important because they bought FB and UBR early. Nobody cares. 

Elon is surprisingly rare exception in this pool. He made money and decided to do cool shit. That's what optionality is all about. All your "optionality" is worthless if you don't choose good options once you have them. 

To go a step back, basic idea of investing is to use your resources now to have more resources in the future. Everything good in life comes from delayed gratification. Learning new skill might create completely new world for you. For example if I didn't learn math, programming, or english I'd have very different spectrum of opportunities than I have now.

There are still new opportunities for investment as well. I can invest into my social skills, machine learning skills, analytical skills, etc. Main bottleneck here is my time, not money. But I'm still looking for good price/reward ratio. For example now I feel like I can gain a lot by becoming better analytical thinker by relatively little effort, so I'm writing this text. 

*Note: here is my [airtable script](https://github.com/Matoo125/airtable-finance-script) for managing my financial investment strategy and portfolio. I decided to keep it out of this text as this is rather philosophical in nature. Look there for more details.*

## Giving
As I wrote above, diminishing returns for investing into yourself can come quickly. The opportunities arise to invest into your family (such as future of your children), community, country or the world. 

## Debt
I used to be afraid of debt as many people, but with better understanding of financial systems I became a big fan. Takes courage though. Personally don't expect to be in debt unless I will buy a house or start a business.

## Trends
Human GDP goes to the moon. Better to take a ride.

## Big expenses
Big expenses are: apartment, children, and early retirement.
