Another great month in quarantine, and also the last one, at least here in the Czech Republic. This was a precious time for me. As a person who spends his holiday going to silent meditation retreats, this government-imposed isolation was an opportunity for me to spend more time with myself, and work on self-understanding.

And also work a lot on projects, such as Metaculus, and helping GFI Europe with recruitment efforts. I found myself in a better position, than many people, working remotely prior to the situation, I could adjust more easily, and also my job felt more important and fulfilling. So boredom was lacking in my experience and plenty of project/activity ideas had to be postponed or canceled.

I haven't found much time for reading, writing, learning, and not as much time for socialization as I would like to. Specifically I failed following projects 

-   Fill the calculus gap
-   Create anki habit
-   Write regularly
-   And many other smaller / harder to describe ones

Not everything was perfect, it's kind of silly that part of me is still expecting that, but my overall experience was clearly a positive one, and I feel there is plenty of positive energy in my body, and useful ideas in my mind, I would like to share with others. 

Mastering the routine
---------------------

Let me start with an obvious statement - What you do every day matters. Each day contains so many opportunities to start losing time, to procrastinate, to avoid doing the hard things. But it's also an opportunity to take a step towards reaching your goals, and becoming the person you want to be.

This begs the questions - what kind of person do I want to be? And what are the steps I should take to get there? You don't have to have a perfect answer to those questions, but everyone has some understanding of their values.

### Meditation

Let's be concrete for a while - what are the routines I implemented and how did it go?

First of all, I'm meditating for 2 hours every day (one hour after waking up in the morning, the second hour before sleep). This is not something I would recommend to everyone, it's super-hard to do, if you are not used to it, it's like starting to run half marathon a day, without previous training. It's asking for injury and bad experience, unlikely to bring desired results.

But it's an important challenge for me - to gain control over my own mind. I already might have close to 1k hours of meditation experience under my belt. Majority of it during the last 18 months (including 2 vipassana retreats). And deciding to do 1h morning and evening for an entire year is still challenging for me. But there is also a lot of joy associated with this activity. And also learning and improvement. Feeling of progress gives me a lot of motivation to continue forward.

Of course there are days, when it feels like you are getting worse than you were a year ago. Those are the most important ones, a strong routine is the best way to go through them, with a sense of purpose. It's not possible to judge your progress on a day to day basis. Variation of the previous sentence stuck in my mind after I read it in the handstand manual. As someone who has been experimenting with reversing their standing posture since 15 years old. This challenging activity showed me clearly, that one day I might be doing the best poses in my life, and week afterwards, I have trouble to find the balance.

But regardless of the surface experience, progress is happening, the body is adjusting, the mind is learning. At least if you practice during the difficult days. I have never applied this advice to my handstands, and after almost 10 years, I still struggle to find the balance. Luckily, I managed to apply it to other activities, and it was super-helpful during previous months.

### Exercise

The luxury of living next to a yoga studio was no longer a privilege. After finding out that doing yoga at home felt tedious, and there is nowhere to swim, there was a pressing need for finding an exercise routine, that is simple, quick and energizing. That's when I found a hundred[ pushups challenge](https://hundredpushups.com/). It's an amazing program that promises you to give you strength to do 100 consecutive push ups after 6 weeks. Being weak my whole life, this was exactly what I was looking for. And I started immediately with an exhaustion test, managed to do about 30 push ups and started to follow the program for the next 60 days. Promised land was not reached in my case, but it didn't matter, since I felt much stronger, could do 40 push ups (a few times a day) or 70 without proper technique. It's not hard to do 200 push ups every other day and that's a huge progress.

Afterwards I started to experiment with pull-ups instead, those are much harder, and introduced a lot of muscle and joint pains in my body. So now I plan to go back to push-ups and do 2 pull-ups a day, to create a strong habit. Also since everything is open again, I will combine it with yoga, swimming and sauna routines.

### WHM

Another surprising routine that happened to meet me were holotropic breathing exercises and cold exposure through showers by Wim Hoff. It's unbelievably energizing and unifying. If meditation is like asking yourself a question "Do you want to be present for a while?", cold showers are like water authoritatively telling you "And now you will be present for a while". There is nowhere to go, your mind needs to start focusing and cooperate with itself. It knows how to handle difficult situations, it just needs to be woken up. I do it for about 80 days now and plan to continue.

### Relationships

Regular social interactions can give me a lot of energy. This is somehow interesting, since I'm leaning strongly on the introverted side. It's not like I would want or need to talk with someone all day long, but to interact 30min to 2hours each day with someone brings me a lot of joy and feeling of ease. Often after working all day, my mind becomes somehow obsessed about some task at work that is difficult for me to do. And then I might start to determine my self-worth from my inability to easily finish the task at hand.

This is when communicating with someone comes in hand. During quarantine I was able to create quite a strong habit of calling people daily, especially family members, but also friends. It gave me a lot of positive energy, and made me feel good about myself. That's useful, if I want to wake up the next day and feel good enough about myself to work all day without getting distracted. And also it brings something to my day I can look forward to.

### Work
I did worked 8-10h a day, including breaks. Here I utilized [Ultraworking](https://ultra.work/cycles-minimal) technique, combined with [Focusmate](focusmate.com/) sessions and pomodoro technique.
