Writing is one of the most useful general skills one can develop. At least that's a story I'm telling myself.

## Types of content
There are different types of content we could be writing.
- journaling
- note-taking
- blog
- essay
- long-content

Each has different characteristics and use cases. Some are aimed to be published, others are for personal benefit. Some should be important and long-lasting, others might matter much less.

Depending on your life situation and goals, you might choose, which would be the best tool to support you. (keep in mind that none is always the option)

My current interest lies mostly in note-taking and long-content. 

## Tips and Tricks
Here are some tips and tricks I have found useful. 

**Writing is thinking**
> The brain is no place for serious thinking. If you're thinking about something important and complicated, write it down. – Jack Altman

Writing reflects and supplements good thinking. It allows us to go into more detail and notice flaws and blindspots in our arguments.

Some people might be much better thinkers than writers. Some professional writers might be not so great thinkers. Writing is thinking tool that allows us to explore our ideas more deeply. We could write bunch of content without asking whether it's actually useful.

Don't get confused by arbitraty metrics, such as number of words, or beauty of your sentences. What are the ideas hidding behind them? How does it helps us to understand the world and make better decisions? Those are the important questions we need to keep in mind.

**Craft requires practice** - There is common debate among writers. Is it more like an art, or a craft? Or in other words, does writing require momentary inspiration, or you can do writing the same way as you can do baking. Baker wakes up each morning early and starts baking routine. 

Many of us perceive writing as a craft. You get inspiration and the content is created in that burst of energy. There are professional writers on both sides, but many more are on the craft side than you might expect.

Writing is difficult and it takes time. There is absolutely no way of becoming professional athlete without a ton of practice. The same could be said about becoming a great artist. In any case to become good writers we need to practice.  
> People think you need to be inspired to write. No, you write in order to get inspired. - Paul Jarvis

**Art of writing well is rewriting** - It's common misconception that your content should be good as you are writing your first draft. The first draft is always bad. By tryng to make the first draft look good, we get stuck and make the whole experience painful. It's hard to think about what you want to write, how does good sentence look like, and how all of this fits together at the same time. 

Great writers simplify this by splitting the problem into two (or more) stages. First you write draft by putting your raw thoughts on the page. Then you rewrite it, change sentence structures, remove what's not useful, etc. Repeat this process until you end up with something satisfaying. 

> When you write a first draft, you write it for yourself. When you rewrite it, you write it for everyone else. – Stephen King

**System 1 and System 2 writing** - The process of writing can be seen as dance between our fast and intuitive system 1, and more analytical slow and reflective system 2. What often happens to beginer writers such as myself is that we get stuck on trying too hard to write with system 2. That is difficult thing to do. 

On the other hand if you just write whatever comes to your mind you rarely endup with the content you want to share with others. So how can we make these two systems work together?

The ideal scenario is when we switch between s1 and s2. We start with s2 and think about what we want to write about, what are the main points we want to make, etc. Then we switch to s1 and draft some of the content. Then we switch to s2 and read what we have wrote. We repeat this process until we are satisfied with the result. 

S1 loves to write and doesn't get stuck so easily. It makes plenty of mistakes along the way and you need to train it to enjoy the process. You need to develop trust towards your intuitive writing. One good way to do that is to play around with free flow writing. 

**Free flow writing** - is when you write anything that comes to your mind, you don't think about it twice. You don't think anything that goes in different direction than your keyboard. You won't show what you have written to anyone, In fact you don't need to read it yourself. It's just about getting the words from your mind to the page. This can have interesting effect of allowing you to let go of some thoughts that were holding you in your mind. 

The way to do it is to give yourself 10-20 minutes everyday to just write anything that's on your mind. It helps to write quickly so that you can type more closely to the speed of your thoughts and don't need to slow yourself down. But it would probably also work in any other way, I just have no experience with that.

## Other notes
> Here’s an exercise I used with my children and nephews. When I saw them doing dense reading in a history or science textbook, I would ask, “When you get to the exam in a month or two, what do you want to remember from this chapter?” Then I’d say, “After reading this chapter, please write no more than the one or two paragraphs you want to remember for the exam. Then go back and see how you could read more efficiently to obtain that paragraph or two.”
> 
> When it comes to writing something longer than an e-mail, the key is to first figure out your argument. If I don’t fully understand my line of argument, I cannot write even a paragraph. To do this, compose an outline before writing. For an article or a memorandum, that means just four or five key points with a few subpoints under each. I’ve seen many executives realize what they wanted to say only after they had written a lengthy draft. That is unfortunate. You should know where you will end up before you start.
