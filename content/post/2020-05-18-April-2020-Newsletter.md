After considering how I want to interact with the internet, I decided to try a newsletter experiment. 

Writing is somehow hard for me and I want to get better. Few posts were written by me over the past few years, but habit was never created. I always need to start again. So this time I hopefully figured out how to keep the bar low enough to sustain regularity. My idea is to post each month about the most interesting things I did, read or found out about the past month. 

This fits well with my new routine of keeping track of stuff daily. It allows me to share what I care about, outside of social media immediate gratification traps. Some people are fine just posting daily on social media, but based on my experience, I think it’s difficult for me not to lose control, so I decided to stop using them a couple of years ago. 

This format allows me to be myself and not try to prove anything, or to make the result perfect. That was one of the biggest problems with my past attempts when creating writing habits. I took the result too seriously, and didn’t create enough wiggle room to be myself. So from now, until the end of the year, I want to write a monthly newsletter, that will be essentially equivalent to aggregating fb posts that were never published. 


## Metaculus

Since December I work for a prediction platform [https://metaculus.com](https://metaculus.com). We became more popular after the coronavirus epidemic, and decided to launch a dashboard focused on people who want to consume the results of our predictions. This project took me a lot of time, including weekends so I didn’t have that much time for other activities.

If you want to find out more about Metaculus, [here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToE8wDWHKXU&feature=youtu.be) our founder Anthony presenting the platform at the Foresight Institute event. Also you can check our informative [FAQ](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/). 

Bonus: Interesting tweet about best forecaster on the platform considering worldwide pandemic 39 days before WHO [https://twitter.com/metaculus/status/1248966351508692992](https://twitter.com/metaculus/status/1248966351508692992)


## Coronatime

“So I’ll make the least bad prediction that one can make after a very traumatic experience like 9/11 or Covid-19; nothing will change after the epidemic is over.” By [Scott Summer](https://www.econlib.org/the-least-bad-prediction-of-our-post-coronavirus-future/)

As everyone else, I have spent a significant amount of time reading, listening and thinking about COVID-19 epidemic. One of the most interesting sources for me was Tyler Cowen’s [https://marginalrevolution.com](https://marginalrevolution.com)

I also spent a couple of weekends and nights supporting the epidemicforecasting.org project, but then decided to leave it to others, since it wasn’t sustainable with my other activities. And there were a lot of skilled people participating already.  Anyway, it’s an interesting project creating public forecasting models and helping decision makers to make a better sense of the situation and [dance with the R](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56).

Team at 80 000 hours and Rob Wiblin did a spectacular job covering the situation. I wasn’t watching all the details (e.g. several daily FB posts), but the material they published on their sites is great.

Many projects are trying to predict the impact of this pandemic. Some of the best efforts are supported by the Open[ Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/forecasting-covid-19-pandemic) project. Including, of course, the [Good Judgement Project](https://goodjudgment.io/covid/dashboard/).  Also at [Metaculus](https://pandemic.metaculus.com/questions/), the project I introduced earlier, we are aggregating thousands of predictions about the situation from our users. Many of them are skilled forecasters. And we published a new[ dashboard](https://pandemic.metaculus.com/dashboard/) that displays the result of these predictions (~weighted average) in a more user-friendly manner. 

I could spend hours in this section, going into all sorts of details, but I want to publish this sometime soon, so this has to be it. There are few links I found interesting at the end
