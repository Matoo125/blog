## How to start if I'm total beginner?
Probably the easiest way to start is to download one of the popular meditation apps.

- If you have local meditation group go there and try it out. 
- If you have friends who meditate, contact them and do session together.
- Apply for a meditation retreat. It will motivate you to start practicing to prepare for it.

## What should I do if I want to progress?
Metitation apps have their limits, and it's hard to get over 5-20 minutes relaxation routine with them. The single best thing I can recommend is to go for a meditation retreat. 

Retreats are surprisingly accessible all over the world, and often completely donation based. I have experience with Goenka vipassana, and Thai Forest tradition. Both are great. 

To make a progress it's necessary to develop daily meditation practice. And it's great if you can find more experienced meditators to talk to and debug your issues.

## Why meditate?
- to develop compassion and care for other beings
- to be at peace with yourself and become your own best friend
- to create distance between your thoughts and actions
- to have amazing experiences while sitting with your eyes closed
- to become at peace with aging, sickness, and death
- to face your fears, anxieties and deamons
- to find inner peace no matter the circumstances
- to reflect what is really important in your life
- to be able to let go of your identity and need for control
- to learn about the inner workings of your mind

As you can see there are many possible reasons why meditate. Note that if you want to reduce stress, or improve your productivity, it might be more efficient to improve your sleep, diet, relationships or exercise more. As well if you have some mental health issues, it might be easier to see therapist. 

Meditation can be powerful tool to develop loving-kindness towards all beings, fighting your deamons, developing beautiful place inside yourself.

## Reasons not to meditate
**Meditation takes time**
Anybody who can actually use the time better should do it! Look at Elon Musk. He thinks meditation is boring, but he is doing much more for benefit of others than any buddhist monk. If you can work all day on important problems, what's the point for meditation?

Benefits might disappear rather quickly, once you stop practicing. It takes a lot of time to practice daily for years to sustain yourselves. If you can use your time better, do it. But most people don't use their time better.

Meditation can help us to realize what we want to work on. For example by allowing us to see past our greed and status signaling desires. 

**Science is not ready for strong claims**
As written in a book [Altered Triats](https://www.amazon.com/Altered-Traits-Science-Reveals-Meditation/dp/0399184384) by world experts on meditation research. There is not enough scientific evidence for strong claims. Most of the studies involved either 10 minute meditators, or dedicated practicioners with decades of experience. Most of the studies have small sample sizes as well. 

Many meditators aim to see the reality more clearly, though success is not guaranteed. We need to keep in mind that it's easy to delude ourselves. Meditation might lead us to dark alleys, such as [spiritual materialism](https://www.amazon.com/Cutting-Through-Spiritual-Materialism-Chogyam/dp/1570629579). 

**No death for me**
Arguably one of the most important parts of meditation in buddhist context is becoming at peace with aging, sickness and death. What if you rather become obsessed by solving these problems? Many transhumanists believe death is terrible and we should try hard to figure out how to avoid it. 

Though we might be able to overcome death on some level and allow people to live for thousands of years, everything comes with a cost. We migh become obsessed about our lives, identity, and possesions, if the cost of making mistakes is infinite life. 

**Ultimately, only our actions matter**
The most sucessfull people in the world don't meditate. There are other techniques that can give us most of the benefits of meditation with less effort.

What's the point of meditation if the world is suffering? Well meditation is presented as the path out of suffering. Though there seem to be much better ways of doing good.

Why we don't see any englighnement monks pursuing revolutionary research in medicine, or space engineering? That seems like exactly the thing enlightnement person who cares about helping others should be doing. 

## Common misconceptions about meditation
**Meditation is boring** - Meditation can be boring, and as someone who meditates regularly, I confess that it's often the case (especially if I don't practice properly). We get bored if nothing sustains our attention. Art of meditation is about learning to pay attention in the present moment. Many times I was surprised to notice how interesting it's to be aware of my pure sensations, once I managed to pay close attention. 

**Meditation will fix all my problems** - Meditation can improve our lives significantly, buy we are better off not expecting magical results. One extreme is to think that all of our problems are in the outside world. The other is expecting to solve everything just by retreating inside. 

We need to act in the real world. The real progress on our paths can be measured by actions we take and the way we behave towards other people and ourselves. Sitting in meditation is often not the best action we can do. We need to work, take care of ourselves, help other people.

**Meditation won't help me** - We all need to help ourselves, but meditative awareness can help us to facilitate that process. As I wrote above - meditation is not a cure for all of our problems. We need to act in the real world as well. At the same time, the situations we encounter are mostly ordinary. (Despite our best efforts to convince ourselves otherwise). Many of our problems could be fixed, or directed by learning to be at peace with ourselves.

Meditation might not help you with some of your goals, such as building rockets that will take humanity to mars, or building alternative funding structure to academia. (those are examples of exceptional projects by people who don't find much benefit in meditation afain)

If your goal is to change the world by building companies, meditation might be distraction. There are not many examples (i.e. Jack Dorsey, Sam Harris) of people who are changing the world and take meditation seriously. 

It's not a practice to build a better startup, but to find a peace of mind wherever you are. That is very useful for most people. If that's what you want, meditation will help you.

**Meditation is about hiding from the world** - Meditation might become a form of escapism from our problems in the real world. I believe we need to be aware that this is real possibility and check our motivation regularly. 

Meditation is a technique of becoming more engaged in this world. We become more aware of our feelings, and allow ourselves to feel more. We should try to develop more interest in the world, by caring about other beings. We should develop desire to understand the world, and see things more clearly. 

As you can we can either start hiding from the world, or become more engaged, and alive. 

**Meditation is too hard for me, my mind is too distracting** - That's a very good reason to develop your meditation practice. In fact many people become life-long meditators after realizing that seemingly simple task of focusing on your breath for 5 full breaths without distracting yourself is almost impossible. Meditation is an amazing practice to develop inner peace.

## Meditation mistakes people make
**Trying too hard**  and **Not trying hard enough** are the most common mistakes of meditators. We often bounce between these two extremes, without finding sustainable balance between them.  

Examples of not trying hard enough
- I don't make time to do my meditation
- When meditating I don't try to let go, and indulge in day dreaming
- I use excuses to avoid facing myself and doing the work

Examples of trying too much
- I feel tense in my body, find it difficult to relax and let go, but want to push through
- There are more important things I need to do, but I push through my meditation being lost in thought
- I regularly feel sad, low energy, restless during the practice

**Ignoring the moral aspect of the practice**
Meditation can become a selfish act of avoiding suffering and reaching pleasurable states. Other people might meditate to reduce stress and improve their productivity.

If we think in terms of what can I get out of the practice all the time, we might become selfish and full of ourself. Indulged in spiritual materialism. Proving ourself that we are better than other people, because we can sit with our eyes closed while focusing on our breath. 

Meditative practice in spiritual sense is about becoming selfless. Letting go of greed, hatred and desire. Living for the benefit of others. Becoming completely compassionate.

For advanced practicioners, following eightfold noble path, or some good enough alternative is essential. 

## Meditating in different postures
Proper meditation posture is ofen underestimated meditators. We need to have our backs streight to avoid falling into sleep or dullness.  **Sitting** is usually the best way to meditate. But there are alternative postures worth exploring. 

What is important in all of them is to keep the awareness in your body. That's surprisingly difficult and it took me months of practice to be able to meditate regularly in different postures. If you practice deliberately, you might be able to learn this more quickly. 

**Standing meditation** is one of my favourite practices these days. When I feel like I have been sitting too much, or have a pain in my back, I start my meditation standing. The attention is moving between my feet, breath, and the rest of the body. 

It's similar to sitting practice, you don't want to do any extra movements. Following simple breath or body awareness. One important difference is that you cannot ignore your feet, they are probably the best meditation object when standing. Notice that your body never stops moving. We cannot stand still, there is always little dance happening. 

Enjoy being in your body.

**Walking Meditation** is another practice that is useful to have in your toolbox. There are several ways of doing this, and below I'll outline 3 approaches

Thai vipassana walking style - is systematic approach, where we divide each step into several distinct movements, and focus on each of them separately. This [audio recording](https://insighttimer.com/mcbrigitte/guided-meditations/walking-meditation) is a great way to learn the practice. 

Zen walking style - I have no personal experience with Zen teachings. But they are walking very slowly during meditation, and I have tried to do that myself. I love slow walking. It's a very calming practice. It helps me to realize that I don't need to run all the time. 

Next level, that is a bit more experimental would be to develop mindfulness of the body during any other physical movements. 

*Note: Embodiement practices, such as Contact Improvisation seems to be a great way of practicing body awareness. Though tradition is very different.*

**Laying down meditation**
Teachers often don't recommend beginner meditators to meditate when laying down. The reason for this is that it's easy to fall asleep, unless you develop stronger mindfulness. 

I personaly cannot meditate often laying down even after years of practice. Though I have made tangible progress and can enjoy it now from time to time. We are all different and some people gain a lot from laying down practice.

I like to focus on my belly rising and falling when laying down. It helps to put one of my hands on my belly, and the other on my chest, and watch the natural movements. It's all happening without any effort from my side. I can notice my inner state through my breathing pattern. For exaple I might at first think that I'm calm, but then realize that my belly goes down on in-breath, not out.

## Meditating in different ways
**Sleep meditation**
Is mostly unexplored teritory from my side. Though there are well developed practices that can help us to meditate during night. I want to expand further on this in the future. In Tibetian tradition there is long-standing practice of [dream yoga](https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Yoga-Illuminating-Through-Dreaming/dp/1622034597) where we use lucing dreaming to practice during our dreams. More advanced practicioners claim to be able to practice even during deep sleep. 

The most approachable technique for night practice seems to be [Yoga Nidra](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Yoga_nidra). It explores the state between sleeping and being aware, just before you fall asleep, or right after you wake up.

**Chores meditation**
>"To my mind, the idea that doing dishes is unpleasant can occur only when you aren’t doing them…I enjoy taking my time with each dish, being fully aware of the dish, the water, and each movement of my hands.  I know that if I hurry in order to eat dessert sooner, the time of washing dishes will be unpleasant and not worth living.  That would be a pity, for each minute, each second of life is a miracle.”
> Tich Nhat Hanh

**Movement meditation**
Any movement can become practice. ([Ido Portal,](http://www.idoportal.com/) [Movement Parallels Life](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClAA3ne4EIls0NXvv0s7rSw), and plenty of others are trying to make body fitness more mindful, and more fun!)

## Meditative traditions
- Today we are often introduced to meditation outside of the context of Buddhism. That has many benefits, for example we can accept the practice without accepting the whole religion. At the same time, there is a lot of wisdom hidden in these traditions. I won't spend too much time with that now, but here are few points. 

- We cannot escape old age, suffering and death. Meditating on these factors is essential in the Buddhism, but they might get ignored in simplified western interpretation. 

- David Chapman wrote interesting [posts](https://vividness.live/sutra-vs-tantra) about difference between Tantra and Sutra buddhism. His writing helped me to update on [history](https://vividness.live/consensus-buddhism) of buddhism, and how it was influenced by protestant christianty. 

- [Why I'm not a Buddhist](https://www.amazon.com/Why-I-Am-Not-Buddhist/dp/0300226551) is an interesting book by Evan Thompson, experienced meditator and cognitive sciences researcher. It's a critique of modern presentation of Buddhism in the western world.
