[note: If the idea that map is not a territory is already intuitive to you, reading this might bring you nothing. Those who are new to explicit thinking about mental models and rationality might find this useful]

[note: Obviously, this text is simplification of reality. Please let me know if you have an idea how to make it more useful.]

[note: Map is not the territory, menu is not the meal, photograph is not the thing photographed, word is not the thing it describes, the thing is not the category to which it belongs, model is not the thing modeled are all metaphorical ways to say abstraction (or belief) is not reality.]

When you try to explain some complicated idea, such as benefits of creating models of charity effectiveness, or benefits of investing instead of keeping all your assets in the bank, or why there are better things to do than arguing about the newest conspiracy theory, you are at risk of at least one type of typical backslash. 

*You cannot rely on X, because it’s just model (truth) and it doesn’t take into account all the possible variables (truth), therefore it is useless (false).* Or *therefore it’s no better than any other model (false)*. Or *therefore it is incomplete (truth) and you are not fully aware how it is incomplete (truth), so you are mistaken (truth) and your model is not worth considering (false)*

One side is accusing the other of ***thinking*** *that their model is absolutely matching the reality*, and uses it as an reason to discredit the model,  because it is the easier thing to do as compared to looking for possibilities to improve the model itself. If we want to make progress in our discourse we need to understand and be aware that the other side understands that *map is not the territory.*

Yes, people confuse maps with territory. Everyone does to some degree, when I see the tree in reality it’s just reflection of light waves hitting my retinas within wavelength range my eyes are sensitive to, traveling through my optic nerve and forming image in my brain and consciousness… there - it’s a tree.  Some maps are immensely convincing and easy to get attached to. They have millions of years of evolution to back them up. 

*A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.* - Alfred Korzybski

Models can simplify the reality to limited amount of variables that are important and comprehensible. They shouldn’t match reality perfectly, in fact it would make them downright useless. Their utility lies in their abstraction. If we had a map which absolutely matched the theritory in every way, it would be copy of the territory itself, and it could not help us find the train station.

So models are useful when they lead to better results than alternatives. And there is no way to go around them. One needs to make decision based on something. Surely, it can be intuition or feelings, they can be seen as tools in the same way as abstract mathematical calculation. In case of intuition and feelings the process is more subconscious and was largely developed during our long evolution (and possibly improved during our lives), and the mathematical abstraction was mostly developed during past few hundreds years with the raise of scientific method and wisdom passed down over generations through academic institution. 

People are generally doing what they consider to be the best thing, based on their current goals and values. Not necessarily the best possible thing to achieve their goals and values. With improved understanding of the world (better model used in specific situation), action can become more optimal.

Models are heavily context dependent. In the past, colorful juicy items with pleasant aroma, hanging from a tree branches often signalized nutrition and survival, so we developed mechanisms to gather and eat them. Today following that guideline would bring us early death and obesity. It's like using map of ancient Greece in modern day Singapore. So we draw a map which better describes the territory we need to navigate in, and decide to read labels and eat only food without added sugar, or whatever diet is believed to keep you alive throughout this century.

Once we agree that all models are wrong (read - not describing reality perfectly) we can call it a day, go to sleep with smiles on our faces, celebrate for a week with live music, dancing on the roofs, setting off fireworks, reading books, discussing ethics or however one likes to celebrate, and afterwards if we still constructively talk about models, not separating ourselves into incompatible fractions because of our absolute believes (or our complex believes and absolute believes of the others), we can celebrate again. 

If you are willing to play a game of thinking about and improving mental models. There are two basic questions you want to answer. 1. Will this help me make a better decisions? (or is it in some way better than my current mental models?) 2. Can I improve this mental model in any meaningful way? (do I have mental models, that lead to better outcomes, and am I able to offer them?)

Knowing that you are wrong might make you be more open to new evidence, since you are waiting to see the specificities of your wrongness. When you become a stakeholder in a belief it can make you more biased towards the evidence that is opposing it in some way. 

For example I recently asked founder of bio bakery, what he thinks about GMO, and he basically said, he thinks it’s terrible, because it feels bad, and we should not play gods with nature. Even though the evidence points to GMO having benefits and not being dangerous. 

(I don’t know his actual thought process and there are many ways to improve our food production. Maybe GMOs are good rule of thumb for people to use. And company would have hard time communicating that they are the good guys, but bio certification kind of sucks in some ways, so they decided not to use it.)

Many vegans, including vegan doctors and me are having trouble to update on possible benefits of ketogenic diet, after telling everyone for years that meat is not healthy, ever. Or meat eaters and me are slow to update on moral value of animals after objectifying them as non living products one can buy in supermarket and has a right to buy. Or many random people and me not accepting beliefs of effective altruism after thinking that not doing harm and randomly doing good when I feel like it is the best I can do and wanting to keep feeling good about that. 

The point is that changing believes is hard, so we should make an effort to learn how to do it more effectively. 

Accept that you are wrong, seek the advice of those that are less wrong, give the advice to those that are in some way more wrong. And this is how we can create feedback loop to collective and personal wisdom, flying pigs and rainbows in the air. 

*All models are wrong but some are useful* - George Box
