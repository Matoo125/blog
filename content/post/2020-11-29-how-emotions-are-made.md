# How Emotions Are Made

*Note: This was written in 2h timebox, so it’s kind of raw and unfinished.*

Our theory of emotions is wrong. They are not in-born but learned and embedded in our culture. Emotions are social concepts we use to help our predictive brain understand the world around us.

How Emotions Are Made, the book by psychologist Lisa Feldman Barrett clearly exceeded my expectations. She argues that there is lack of evidence for the currently popular Classical View of emotions. And much stronger evidence supporting Constructive Theory of emotions. 

The classical view of emotions argues that happiness, fear, and other emotions have unique, biological fingerprints that are universal and have been passed down to humans through evolution.

Many people, including scientists, seem to hold this view, but Lisa says there is no good evidence for that. 

> To be sure, hundreds of experiments offer some evidence for the classical view. But hundreds more cast that evidence into doubt. The only reasonable scientific conclusion, in my opinion, is that emotions are not what we typically think they are.

So what exactly are the emotions? Lisa thinks they are constructed by our brains, based on learned concepts. Her Theory of Constructed Emotions says:

> In every waking moment, your brain uses past experience, organized as concepts, to guide your actions and give your sensations meaning. When the concepts involved are emotion concepts, your brain constructs instances of emotion.

She offers plenty of examples contrary to the belief that emotions are universal. For example, some cultures have emotions, other culture don’t. People from different cultures can correctly categorize “basic emotions” only if they were taught the emotion concepts before. 

> And consider this fun fact: the historical record implies that ancient Greeks and Romans did not smile spontaneously when they were happy. The word “smile” doesn’t even exist in Latin or Ancient Greek. Smiling was an invention of the Middle Ages, and broad, toothy-mouthed smiles (with crinkling at the eyes, named the Duchenne smile by Ekman) became popular only in the eighteenth century as dentistry became more accessible and affordable. The classics scholar Mary Beard summarizes the nuances of the point: This is not to say that Romans never curled up the edges of their mouths in a formation that would look to us much like a smile; of course they did. But such curling did not mean very much in the range of significant social and cultural gestures in Rome. Conversely, other gestures, which would mean little to us, were much more heavily freighted with significance. Perhaps sometime in the last few hundred years, smiling became a universal, stereotyped gesture symbolizing happiness.* Or . . . perhaps smiling in happiness is simply not universal.

Emotions are real, but they are part of our social reality. The same way as money or companies are. They help us to live in the world, but are less objective then we might think. 

> As children grow up, they definitely form a whole conceptual system for emotion. This includes all the emotion concepts they’ve learned in their lives, anchored by the words that name those concepts. They categorize different facial and bodily configurations as the same emotion, and a single configuration as many different emotions. Variation is the norm. So where is the statistical regularity that holds together a concept like “Happiness” or “Anger”? In the words themselves. The most visible commonality that all instances of “Anger” share is that they’re all called “anger.”

Distinguishing between social and physical reality

> We all walk a tightrope between the world and the mind, and between the natural and the social. Many phenomena that were once considered purely mental—depression, anxiety, stress, and chronic pain—can, in fact, be explained in biological terms. Other phenomena that were believed to be purely physical, like pain, are also mental concepts. To be an effective architect of your experience, you need to distinguish physical reality from social reality, and never mistake one for the other, while still understanding that the two are irrevocably entwined.

So our brains are predicting our emotions, based on our sensory inputs and past experience. I might have emotional concept of being angry when things are not going according my plan, and my heart rate increases, so when my brain recognizes this pattern, I start to experience anger. 

On the other hand, I could create new experiences and re-categorize my sensory inputs. Maybe I have just high energy strategy updating situation. My plan didn’t work as expected, so now I have this extra boost of energy to adjust to the new situation and prepare for the future. No need for anger in any way. 

> Your brain is always predicting, and its most important mission is predicting your body’s energy needs, so you can stay alive and well. These crucial predictions, and their associated prediction error, turn out to be a key ingredient for making emotions. 

**Body budget** is a metaphor for how your brain allocates energy resources within your body. 

Regulating body budgets in social situations. Well imagination is enough.

> To perturb your budget, you don’t even require another person or object to be present. You can just imagine your boss, teacher, coach, or anything else relevant to you. Every simulation, whether it becomes an emotion or not, impacts your body budget. As it turns out, people spend at least half their waking hours simulating rather than paying attention to the world around them, and this pure simulation strongly drives their feelings.

But other people definitely help

> When it comes to managing your body budget, your brain does not have to go it alone. Other people regulate your body budget too. When you interact with your friends, parents, children, lovers, teammates, therapist, or other close companions, you and they synchronize breathing, heart beats, and other physical signals, leading to tangible benefits. Holding hands with loved ones, or even keeping their photo on your desk at work, reduces activation in your body-budgeting regions and makes you less bothered by pain. If you’re standing at the bottom of a hill with friends, it will appear less steep and easier to climb than if you are alone. If you grow up in poverty, a situation that leads to chronic body-budget imbalance and an overactive immune system, these body-budgeting problems are reduced if you have a supportive person in your life. In contrast, when you lose a close, loving relationship and feel physically ill about it, part of the reason is that your loved one is no longer helping to regulate your budget. You feel like you’ve lost a part of yourself because, in a sense, you have. 

My brain is always predicting the next experience.

**Affective Realism** is the phenomenon that interoception influences what you see, hear, and otherwise perceive.

> Affective realism, the phenomenon that you experience what you believe, is inevitable because of your wiring. The body-budgeting regions in your interoceptive network—your inner loudmouthed, mostly deaf scientist with a megaphone—are the most powerful predictors in your brain, and your primary sensory regions are eager listeners. Body-budget predictions laden with affect, not logic and reason, are the main drivers of your experience and behavior.

> Nobody can completely escape affective realism. Your own perceptions are not like a photograph of the world. They are not even a painting of photographic quality, like a Vermeer. They are more like a Van Gogh or Monet.

> But you can recognize affective realism by its effects. Anytime you have a gut feeling that you know something to be true, that’s affective realism. When you hear some news or read a story that you immediately believe, that’s affective realism too. Or if you are immediately dismissive of a message, or even dislike the messenger, that is also affective realism. We all like things that support our beliefs, and usually dislike things that violate those beliefs.

> Affective realism is an inevitability, and yet you are not helpless against it. The best defense against affective realism is curiosity.

Why do we need concepts? Why cannot we perceive the world clearly?

> Without concepts, you’d experience a world of ever-fluctuating noise. Everything you ever encountered would be unlike everything else. You’d be experientially blind and incapable of learning.

**Interoception** is brain’s representation of sensations from your body’s organs, tissues, hormones, and immune system.

> Interoception is also one of the most important ingredients in what you experience as reality. If you didn’t have interoception, the physical world would be meaningless noise to you. Consider this: Your interceptive predictions, which produce your feelings of affect, determine what you care about in the moment—your **affective niche**. From the perspective of your brain, anything in your affective niche could potentially influence your body budget, and nothing else in the universe matters. That means, in effect, that you construct the environment in which you live. You might think about your environment as existing in the outside world, separate from yourself, but that’s a myth. You (and other creatures) do not simply find yourself in an environment and either adapt or die. You construct your environment—your reality—by virtue of what sensory input from the physical environment your brain selects; it admits some as information and ignores some as noise. And this selection is intimately linked to interoception. Your brain expands its predictive repertoire to include anything that might impact your body budget, in order to meet your body’s metabolic demands. This is why affect is a property of consciousness.

Your memory is deeply flawed.

> Psychologist Daniel L. Schacter, one of the world’s experts on memory, tells the story of a brutal rape that took place in Australia in 1975. The victim told police that she’d seen her attacker’s face clearly, identifying him as Donald Thomson, a scientist. Police picked up Thomson the next day based on this eyewitness evidence, but Thomson had an iron-clad alibi: he was being interviewed on television at the time of the rape. It turned out that the victim’s TV was on when the intruder broke into her house, and it was tuned to Thomson’s interview, which ironically was about Thomson’s research on memory distortion. The poor woman had somehow, in her trauma, fused Thomson’s face and identity onto her attacker. Most men falsely accused are not so lucky. Jurors place a lot of weight on eyewitness testimony, yet they accept mistaken identifications just as frequently as correct ones, as long as the witnesses sound confident. In one study of convictions that were later overturned by DNA evidence, 70 percent of the accused were convicted based on eyewitness testimony.

Embodiement

> Your mind is not only a function of your brain but also of the other brains in your culture.

Rationality vs. Emotions

> People don’t have a rational side and an emotional side, with the former regulating the latter.

What are the key ingredients?

> A human brain can create many kinds of minds, yet all human minds do have some common ingredients. For millennia, scholars believed that the inevitable bits of the mind were essences, but they are not. The ingredients are three aspects of the mind that we’ve encountered in this book: affective realism, concepts, and social reality.

## Conclusion

I’d recommend this book for anyone interested in predictive processing theories, or cognitive sciences in general. My favorite chapter is probably 4, and last chapter is nice summary.
