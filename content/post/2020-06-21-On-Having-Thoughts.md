It often happens to me during the meditation, that my mind starts to question the whole process. Why am I even sitting here? What if I could spend this time in a much better way? What am I doing wrong right now? What is my blind-spot? There is underlaying dissatisfaction in my experience. 

While feeling this uncertainty in my whole body, I realize that is hard for me to answer these questions, or even form proper arguments that would convince me to do anything differently. Then in some cases, I just accept the situation and double down my focus on the sensations of my breath. But other times that's not possible, without using much willpower. And I decide to create a space for this desire to contemplate and think about issues that are important for me, whether internal or external. 

Last time this happened I noticed having this underlying feeling telling me, that I should have the answer, or at least arguments showing my understanding of the issue at hand. That I should know what I want, and it should be clear to me how to get it, or at least there should be uncertainty represented by few well defined options. This made me feel sad about my ability to think. Maybe my mind is broken? Why I didn't noticed earlier? Why nobody told me? And few more questions along those lines passed through my mind space. 

After a while I realized that notion of my inability to think well about important issues has it's flaws. My opinions and ideas about topics I spend significant time engaging with, by actively thinking, discussing and writing are much more detailed and nuanced. I can argue for many different perspectives and understand several advantages and pitfalls of each. It's not true that my mind is not able to think. The problem is that I'm not giving myself enough time to engage with ideas I find interesting. 

When I recall part of my life, I was reading 2 hours a day, my mind was pretty excited about what's happening within. Currently that was replaced by mostly meditating 2 hours a day, and it definitely has some advantages, but it has downside of having less well formed perspectives about the world inside of myself. Although the ability to understand my inner world, watch thoughts passing through my mind from a distance, or see emotions as they arise, are huge plus. Also I'm happy about this whole process - noticing when some part of me is not fulfilled, and giving it space to reveal what it desires. 

This text is hopefully not a prolonged argument to stop my yearly meditation challenge. My goal here is to contemplate on my meta-cognition so that I can utilize my thinking brain better. Although I'm open to shortening my practice if I'll be able to use the time well, without procrastination during the days. Based on my past experience this is not the case, and I tend to not use the time better if I shorten my session. 

[Update: my new goal is to replace about one hour of my meditation with reading and writing, since I realized there is not enough hours in the day otherwise.]

So how to think better? There are many ways to approach this problem, but one of the best places to start is making a good decision what to think about. It's so easy to fail here, and then spend plenty of energy optimizing efforts on a wrong path. Not everything leads you where you want to end up. Simple example could be short term pleasure - it's great in the moment, but your future self will be rarely fulfilled that you spent your days procrastinating on Youtube several years ago.

Effective Altruism and Rationality community do a great job of highlighting interesting areas to think about. Making a good decision about your career seems to be extremely important. Thinking about the world's most pressing problems can take us much farther than whatever are the daily news. Understanding big picture history as presented by Harari, Pinker and others. And human nature as explained by Kahneman, Ariely, Hanson and Yudkowsky. Can leverage our ability to think much better than your favoritism procrastination activity. 

Many important thoughts are to be explored in, also philosophy and psychology. How we are supposed to know ourselves, and how to behave? I'd be amazing to have answers to there problems, or more realistically at least not to be totally naive. Nobody has time to explore everything, so we need to learn how to prioritize, what do we want to engage with, what do we want to think about.  Your brainpower is the most precious resource, don't use it carelessly. 

When I try to optimize everything in my life and be productive all day long, except of some forms of active relaxation, people look at me weirdly. They get afraid, because part of them feels like they should behave the same way, and that will lead to burnout. Nobody wants that, and this inner-conflict makes them look away. Try to come up with rationalizations "I can't do that because this and that". But in reality all you are saying is that you can't be the person you want to be, because you can't get over yourself. You can't let go the image of your imperfections that allows you to keep doing the same mistake over and over again.

Once you embrace the fact that you can be anything you want, there is an opportunity to slowly start doing the things you want to be doing. With all your energy and efforts being focused on your goal. Doing what you actually think is the best thing you can be doing can be highly fulfilling and recharging. Maybe your goal is difficult to reach, but even then there will be small wins here and there. Be there fully and you will get the reward of a life well lived. 

III. 

It's essential to think about your life and mind. But it's also useful to think on the object level aboud things you are trying to accomplish. Reflecting and going meta is all great and necessary, and my gut guess is that most of the people are not doing it enough. But many, often  including me might fail in the opposite direction of not spending enough time on the practical aspect of the goal itself. 

Noticing thoughts is important in any stage of the process. One of the most useful things to notice is feeling of confusion. Everyone can recognize it, in some specific situations when it's clear enough, such as when you hear the lecture about a topic you know nothing about, and it's just obvious to you, that your brain parsed close to nothing. For example going to Karl Friston talk on Predictive Coding, when you don't know much about data science or cognitive sciences. 

But in other situations, if we are already learning data science for years, and we see formulas and concepts many times. There is strong feeling of familiarity and "I should know that, I definitely know what it is". But if someone were to ask "Can you explain what that means?" you would be stuck. This is classic situation of confusing familiarity with knowledge, and it seems to be common and not easy to counteract.
