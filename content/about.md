Welcome to my personal blog. You can find here the thoughts my brain has produced. Some are random, others more structured and from time to time I might link to an source. English is not my native language the quality of the writings has a lot of space for improvement. I would love to write more evidence based content, but right now my goal is to train the writing muscle. To overcome the block I decided to follow Pareto principle - ~80% of the effect comes from ~20% of the efforts. Practically it leads to not editing myself too much, not trying to make it perfect, rather keeping it raw and flowing. 



If you are looking for a better content, I can actually help you with that. Below are my recommendations for my favorite podcasts, books and tools.
